1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,709
Okay, I just realized, what we can't do for this thumbnail is,

2
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:07,266
to be fair, I think it's a bit too much text since we have

3
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:10,641
text on screen and then we have all this text here,

4
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:14,809
uhm,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,317
I'm trying to find, like,

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:23,284
the biggest number that he says in the video,

7
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:26,479
it doesn't look like he says anything besides 17k per month,

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:46,657
which honestly sucks. Uh,

9
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:52,441
let's see what happens if you you multiply 17

10
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:56,747
times 12, 200k.

11
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:57,905
That's pretty good.

12
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:40,913
Ideally, we would use this, and maybe

13
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,985
grab this pink. Let's try.

14
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:51,300
Oh, hell yeah. This looks really good.

15
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:54,712
Uh, this just needs to be behind the guy.

16
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,551
And it potentially needs to be bigger.

17
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,631
Design-wise, I like this better,

18
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:30,679
but, uh, if he doesn't say 200k anywhere in the video,

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,687
then we obviously can't really use this.

20
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,077
And then, this is still solid. I would just,

21
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:42,337
I would just use the purple. Uhm,

22
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:43,830
and this one, perfect.
