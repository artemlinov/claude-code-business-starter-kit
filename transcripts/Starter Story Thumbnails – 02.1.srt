1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:04,633
Okay, so, creating the thumbnail for

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:07,346
this next video for Florinpop.

3
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:10,129
Uhm,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,870
I made 500k from different income streams.

5
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:17,690
I made 500k from my project, here's my playbook.

6
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:22,929
Yeah, uhm, the path basically provided some feedback.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,380
I'm and, uhm,

8
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,396
I actually agree with it a lot.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,707
This concept of the thumbnails where it shows like

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:41,640
this, kinda like the breakdown of their income streams or this multipreneur

11
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:46,209
guy, yeah, that shows the breakdown of

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,825
different income streams like that on screen. So what we did in the previous

13
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:54,179
thumbnail, where it's just huge text on screen,

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,185
that doesn't look realistic, which is a,

15
00:00:57,186 --> 00:01:00,008
which is really good feedback, so we'll not do that again,

16
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:06,331
we'll come up with something else, but first let's see what,

17
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:12,208
where is it, let's see what this guy provided us with.

18
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,532
All right,

19
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,828
so we'll definitely, we'll definitely not using this one,

20
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,091
and we'll definitely not using this one, uh,

21
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:28,979
what we're doing again for this thumbnail is we're going for a two thumbnail

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,469
test, thumbnail one is clean,

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,724
simple, no text, just guest at the,

24
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:36,267
at desk slash work environment.

25
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:39,103
And thumbnail two is we're going to do the usual one,

26
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:41,656
uhm, with text on screen.

27
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:43,698
So, yeah,

28
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:48,352
we're not using this one. Here his laptop is too far

29
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:51,699
away. This one is good.

30
00:01:52,202 --> 00:02:02,018
We'll use this one. We'll

31
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:06,875
see

32
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:11,731
how

33
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,994
we can tweak it, maybe,

34
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:18,541
potentially. And we're using this one,

35
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:31,916
definitely. Okay,

36
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:36,555
let's just, let's just generate some

37
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,535
extra space for us to,

38
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:43,981
do I have my, yeah, I have my headphones, uhm,

39
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,294
sorry, let's just generate some extra space.

40
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,970
So it's gonna be MagicExpand,

41
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,735
and we'll just, we'll just do this.

42
00:02:56,853 --> 00:03:00,325
Canvas, uh, Canvas MagicExpand feature is really good,

43
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:05,118
actually, we definitely wanna

44
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,860
use it. Okay,

45
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,465
we'll just go for the cleanest one.

46
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:40,544
Up here, but I don't even think we need to.

47
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,233
Looking at this composition, it looks pretty good.

48
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:47,414
So, in the, uhm, in the title,

49
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:49,775
we have, we have 500k text.

50
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,633
Uh,

51
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:53,487
let's grab

52
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:00,651
But, what we'll also experiment with,

53
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:03,776
is,

54
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:08,339
so, okay, we can make this one 500k.

55
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,754
And then, potentially, even moving him to the side to

56
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:28,692
make the text a bit bigger. Yeah,

57
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,554
you know, it sucks a little bit, because I would like,

58
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:36,554
Nah,

59
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:00,725
it's just not good, it's, It's way too,

60
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,268
Way too below. Uh,

61
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,736
or way too, Way too far,

62
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,288
From the face.

63
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:16,185
So here's what we'll do.

64
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,352
I would love to,

65
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:24,580
Do this type of thumbnail. Does he

66
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:29,702
say a cool

67
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:36,907
MRR, Number?

68
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:41,907
Don't

69
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,311
think so.

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,694
Yes, 500k over six years.

71
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:00,971
That's going to be not a good number.

72
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:06,211
We're not putting 7k,

73
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,337
7k MRR in the title or in the thumbnail.

74
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:14,666
Okay, so we'll just do, we'll just do,

75
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:18,003
we'll just do 500k like this.

76
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:22,801
And then for this one,

77
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,367
you know, this is kind of interesting. An issue with this photo,

78
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:31,085
like if you look at this photo, it's so much better just because again

79
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,096
the laptop is just closer.

80
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,371
So we would need to do some Photoshop magic there.

81
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:43,528
I'm thinking, or potentially,

82
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:49,099
can we do it in Canva? If I just do BG remover,

83
00:06:55,256 --> 00:07:00,134
Yeah, yeah, I wish Canva had selection

84
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:03,967
tool, whatever. Now let's focus on this thumbnail first.

85
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:07,080
So let's just get this right real quick.

86
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,945
Again, not very ideal.

87
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:23,640
I don't want to... maybe I should make this smaller just because

88
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:25,658
I feel like it... I feel like maybe I'm making them a bit too

89
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:30,643
big sometimes. To the point where it feels

90
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:39,614
unnatural. Okay,

91
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:44,507
let

92
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:49,120
me try to make it bigger

93
00:07:49,121 --> 00:08:05,171
now. No. Yeah,

94
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:09,469
I wish, I wish he just held his laptop a bit,

95
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:14,726
because I don't think we can cleanly cut it out in this case.

96
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:23,739
Just because, like, the shadows there are gonna be messed up and his hand

97
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,687
also. Uhm,

98
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:29,773
that, okay, I'm gonna let Gus know this,

99
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:34,635
that the guests should be taking their photos

100
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,625
better. You know,

101
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm thinking it should be somewhere in the middle almost.

102
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:49,419
Like this big for the photo and then this big for the text.

103
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,740
I like this,

104
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,418
okay. So,

105
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:00,650
we'll just go ahead, do auto adjust,

106
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:04,255
then I'll duplicate this,

107
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:08,882
BG remover, and

108
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,998
yeah, this is unusable. Okay,

109
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:22,304
now, Now. Let's

110
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:28,607
grab this shading tool, although Pat mentions that

111
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:33,545
the shading sometimes makes the backgrounds look AI,

112
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:38,906
which makes sense. But I think

113
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:42,110
if we have it subtly, like that, then it actually helps.

114
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:48,624
Now, we'll just

115
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:53,220
brighten him up. Potentially,

116
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,024
a bit of,

117
00:09:56,738 --> 00:10:01,611
ooh, yeah, this looks better. We don't wanna,

118
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:06,323
Do it too much. We don't wanna do

119
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:11,238
saturation too much either. Maybe vibranze,

120
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,096
not saturation.

121
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,655
Awesome. I love this.

122
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:26,979
What kind of, I do for,

123
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,035
I don't think we can remove the screen here.

124
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,963
I think this thumbnail is just gonna be super simple.

125
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:39,439
Um,

126
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,146
we're just gonna leave this one as is. I would love

127
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:46,427
to do an iteration where,

128
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:53,246
it's a, It's

129
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:57,889
no text, and we just have a graphic

130
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,479
on the screen, but here it's not gonna work just because he's holding his

131
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:06,210
laptop that low. So,

132
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:10,283
we'll experiment with this one though, and I'll start a new room for that.
