1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,108
Alright,

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:05,683
so we're in Photoshop now, uh,

3
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:10,347
let's see, let's see what we can cook

4
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:14,822
up here. So the vision for this is why we're using Photoshop is because

5
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,832
his photo is, again,

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:22,358
not ideal where ideally you would have the camera kind of like tilted

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,554
so that you can see more Okay. His laptop in,

8
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:29,709
in frame, uh, if we look at this thumbnail,

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,583
for example, you can see how much closer his laptop is to his face.

10
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:39,584
So that's what we're gonna try and fix in Photoshop

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,077
while still having it look natural just because that's really,

12
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:51,784
that's really the big thing. The biggest thing for these thumbnails.

13
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,878
Not to make them look AI. Okay,

14
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,152
you know what?

15
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:04,078
I can even,

16
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:12,768
I can even use just the rule of thirds that I have set. Saved.

17
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:15,081
Oh, yeah, it's perfectly on the rule of thirds.

18
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:17,480
Uhm,

19
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,356
this might be a bit too big.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,956
Yeah, just because you kind of want to see his table,

21
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:32,713
if you like, a little bit. Like this.

22
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:39,572
Then you want to frame it nicely. And now,

23
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:44,684
it should be super easy to just take his laptop

24
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:51,375
like that. And I'll just cut

25
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:51,812
it out.

26
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,611
Let's, let's see. So it needs to be,

27
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:11,664
if we imagine how it would be actually

28
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,000
in real life, it would probably be,

29
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,744
Wait, do I have his whole laptop there?

30
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,771
No, he has, Wait,

31
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:27,295
Cool, cut. I cut out in a weird way. Or I cut it out

32
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:31,090
in a weird way. Should have the full thing.

33
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,980
Can I make it snap to the bottom?

34
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:55,980
I

35
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,949
don't know how much better it looks. Maybe I

36
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,747
should do this. Just like, cover his laptop

37
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:29,454
like this. I think that's way too big

38
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:34,323
though. I feel

39
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:39,576
like it

40
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:44,576
should

41
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:50,082
be this

42
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,433
big, roughly.

43
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:55,146
And,

44
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:59,739
I mean, let's just hope that if

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:07,895
I duplicate this, this layer, and I

46
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:13,125
try to content-aware

47
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:14,266
fill his laptop, it's gonna do a good job.

48
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:15,988
Uhm,

49
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:18,680
960, right? I don't know,

50
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:19,490
does

51
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:31,586
this look AI?

52
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,037
I mean, it definitely looks better,

53
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:45,722
but, I'm just not sure if it looks realistic.

54
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:56,690
And yeah, we definitely want to do a bit of a better job cutting

55
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:59,793
out this laptop.

56
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,405
Please help, let me, please help. Play around with

57
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:26,264
Where

58
00:06:31,986 --> 00:07:39,302
Dude, what the hell? So

59
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:43,837
we don't need to cut out that much because on the bottom

60
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:48,139
it has this white outline. But you know,

61
00:07:48,140 --> 00:08:03,415
since we don't need the bottom. Oh

62
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,924
yeah, this is so much better.

63
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:13,464
Damn. Oh damn,

64
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:30,780
this looks actually really good. Oh damn, look at this. We

65
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,101
want to have it perfectly centered,

66
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:37,447
just like that, and then potentially,

67
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,837
what about we add this Apple glowing

68
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:46,743
thing, uhm,

69
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,419
Apple logo, PNG.

70
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,197
This

71
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:59,268
might take a while, just because I'm a newbie in Photoshop,

72
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:05,753
but hopefully I'll figure it out.

73
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:10,753
So,

74
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:21,810
I have no way, why is it

75
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,531
that small?

76
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:39,860
Is it good quality? Yeah,

77
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,923
it is, okay. So,

78
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:45,986
first we wanna, Well,

79
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:48,090
yeah, I know in Photoshop you can,

80
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:54,146
You can just do solid color.

81
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,762
Then you can do this, and then you can do this.

82
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:15,790
And now what I'll do And then

83
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:30,888
know what? Uhm,

84
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,071
let me try to do it the proper way.

85
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,658
I know that somehow. You wanna have it

86
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:54,478
basically. But

87
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,707
then, I don't know what to do here.

88
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,847
Yeah, it just didn't do anything. One

89
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,305
sec, let me figure this out. Okay,

90
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:10,632
I just ended up manually doing it basically.

91
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:13,803
And of what I'll do.

92
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:17,904
Right now, I think it's pretty close.

93
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:24,171
I think if I just apply

94
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,210
some Gaussian blur.

95
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:29,451
Hell yeah.

96
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:37,867
That's clean. I love this.

97
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:43,176
How do I remove this

98
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:47,366
thing? Okay,

99
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:52,070
this looks really good. We basically went from

100
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,900
this to this,

101
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:01,675
which is so much better. And his hands don't

102
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:05,754
look any AI, which is the most important thing ever.

103
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:11,032
So I tried to, or I can try to color grade this in Photoshop.

104
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,880
Honestly, I wouldn't.

105
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:18,387
Let me just save this real quick,

106
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:23,740
just in case. Just

107
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,995
because, I don't know, maybe I should.

108
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,150
Let me,

109
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:33,159
yeah, maybe I should color grade this in

110
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,886
Premiere,

111
00:12:43,703 --> 00:12:46,210
or, sorry, in Photoshop.

112
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:51,210
Let

113
00:12:55,628 --> 00:13:00,582
me export this. Just

114
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,882
because, you know, in Canva, I feel like,

115
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:08,337
really, it looks, it ends up looking like

116
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:09,986
a little bit,

117
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:16,394
I don't know, not,

118
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,512
not cinematic, necessarily.

119
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,485
Potentially even a bit, a tiny bit AI.

120
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:24,502
So if I go to Camera Raw Filter,

121
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,577
and I just, Auto. And then, I add a tiny bit of Lens

122
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:38,152
Blur. Thank you

123
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:43,152
There

124
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:47,960
is some Lens Blur already,

125
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,333
but I think we need a tiny bit more.

126
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,831
worth to add. Hmm,

127
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:20,435
I can't see a vignette here. I think it's worth to add,

128
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:42,105
Now I'm starting to think that this laptop is too big.

129
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:53,828
Yeah, the color grading definitely makes a difference.

130
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,657
Yeah, I'm starting to think that this laptop is too big.

131
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:13,122
Let me just, make it a tiny

132
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:15,253
bit smaller.

133
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,292
I mean, this definitely looks

134
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:39,312
more realistic,

135
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:42,457
but I don't like that, with his hands.

136
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:47,457
Yeah,

137
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:55,401
wait, this actually, this actually looks better.

138
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:19,699
Where is the center again?

139
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,802
Yeah,

140
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:28,952
this is that center.

141
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:42,041
for his hands to,

142
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:46,267
to seem like he's actually working,

143
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:00,470
instead of kind of like resting there.

144
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:05,470
This

145
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:10,727
might be better, actually.

146
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:15,727
Let's

147
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:01,489
generate another one.

148
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:41,348
Oh, yeah, and this,

149
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,660
this, this laptop is definitely better.

150
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:53,682
Okay, awesome. Uh, I'll just export this,

151
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,920
and then we'll color grade it in Canva,

152
00:19:56,921 --> 00:19:59,376
just honestly, because it's easier and faster.

153
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:05,711
Final two. Let's go to Canva.

154
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:06,500
Why isn't it in?

155
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:30,217
Dude,

156
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:34,648
what the hell is this? Can you not open Photoshop?

157
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:41,893
Sorry about this. I don't know what's happening.

158
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,999
It just, it just doesn't get imported.

159
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:49,686
Okay, so all that's done is really color grading.

160
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:53,828
Let me, BG remover,

161
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:57,976
this guy. Oh yeah,

162
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:01,558
this is good. Okay, and it actually looks very realistic.

163
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,646
I love this. Dude,

164
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:09,212
this Photoshop guy is just trying

165
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,085
Okay, this is perfect. Honestly,

166
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:19,415
I love this thumbnail. Hmm,

167
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:25,514
okay, let's see what we can do. So I would bump up the,

168
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:31,513
the vibrance again. I

169
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:34,225
like to add a tiny bit of sharpness,

170
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:37,233
just because it adds that, like,

171
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:39,467
pop and clarity.

172
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,730
Not too much,

173
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,592
but still, you know, still a little bit.

174
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:53,565
Yeah, you don't wanna, you don't wanna make him too ADHD,

175
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:57,489
but I'm almost thinking that it's cause,

176
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:01,366
it's not necessarily the vibrance,

177
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,531
it's cause he gets too yellow.

178
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,478
Alright,

179
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:10,765
well let's see, let's see the before and after.

180
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:15,429
Yeah, yeah, it definitely makes a huge difference.

181
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:30,899
What if I,

182
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:36,786
Also adjust this? Wait,

183
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:39,424
what? What's,

184
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,399
what's happening?

185
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,108
on? don't get this. What,

186
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:00,887
what layer does it change? Yeah,

187
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:04,679
it was changing the other thumbnail the whole time.

188
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:10,682
I don't get how, how this works.

189
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,723
Okay, nice, it actually makes it a lot nicer when we,

190
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:19,342
Bump up saturation and stuff.

191
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:43,372
I think we'll go for something like this. Is

192
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:47,085
this good? Let's see how it was beforehand.

193
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:08,355
And everything, just nothing

194
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:10,573
seems to work. Why does it, anyways,

195
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,713
whatever. Yeah, it, uh, it definitely got a lot nicer,

196
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,405
maybe too much saturation in the background.

197
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,286
Yeah, maybe something like this, but also,

198
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:27,915
you know, we shouldn't overthink it too much.

199
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:54,495
Okay, I think,

200
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:58,184
yeah, I think we did a really good job on this thumbnail.

201
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:03,739
You know, we went from this photo,

202
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:05,333
which was not good.

203
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,801
Not even on the screen.

204
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:23,448
Or the laptop at least, wasn't even on the screen.

205
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:25,953
And we made it look really nice, but it still,

206
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,704
it still looks realistic. So, super happy about this.

207
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:31,851
And yeah, that's it.
