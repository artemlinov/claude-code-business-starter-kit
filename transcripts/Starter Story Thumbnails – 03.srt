1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:04,169
Alright, so we're creating the third thumbnail over here and,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,184
uhm, the title is How I Built It,

3
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:10,943
16k per month, MicroSaaS. Pick a specific niche,

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,920
not a generic market.

5
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:18,243
Okay, so it's basically just gonna be 16k per month,

6
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:21,335
uhm, app. And,

7
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,925
uhm, yeah, let's check out the photos.

8
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:27,183
Bye. I already have them downloaded over here.

9
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:46,513
Okay, so what I don't like about all

10
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:51,087
of, about these four is that you see

11
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:55,454
how far away he is from the camera.

12
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,661
Here, the same thing. Here,

13
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:02,853
he's much closer, which is a lot nicer.

14
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,061
And, uh, here,

15
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:10,150
yeah, I would say, I would say these four are not really usable just

16
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,203
for that reason that is too far.

17
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:17,203
In

18
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:21,969
terms of his face, I probably like this one the most.

19
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:33,015
This one can be good. We're gonna see how it is with,

20
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:38,015
We're

21
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:41,960
gonna see how it is with framing. Uh,

22
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:45,521
there is a thumbnail that is,

23
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:48,624
I think, gonna have a very similar vibe to this one.

24
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,537
Uhm, it's this. I think it's,

25
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:55,495
this one's gonna turn out pretty similar. So,

26
00:01:55,496 --> 00:02:00,533
let's open up Canva. And,

27
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,948
uhm, yeah,

28
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:06,024
try it out, try out creating this thumbnail.

29
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:11,024
Okay,

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,113
so I'll import this photo first,

31
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:29,896
the one that I like the most. He

32
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:35,467
has his, I

33
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:37,573
would do an A-B test here.

34
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:54,039
I would have, Yeah,

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,196
because, like, his hand,

36
00:02:57,536 --> 00:02:59,874
We might need to Photoshop it again.

37
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,096
I think that's gonna be the case.

38
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:08,094
Because without his hand,

39
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,593
it's just a little bit weird,

40
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:15,225
although we're gonna try it. But I think it's just gonna be better

41
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:18,874
if we Photoshop his hand and have him,

42
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,253
like, here. And then

43
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:28,310
have his hand over here.

44
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:33,180
I think it's gonna look natural and

45
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:38,005
not AI. Let's try

46
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,573
this photo. Yeah,

47
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,490
I'm not the biggest fan of this photo.

48
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:55,490
Although,

49
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,432
we can do this potentially, but I'm not sure if AI is gonna be

50
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:03,066
able to generate his hand nicely there.

51
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:11,856
Yeah. Okay. Uh,

52
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,176
so.

53
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:29,337
Should we, should we

54
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:32,493
pull up Photoshop then right away? Let's do it.

55
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:37,462
All right. So I just have this photo over here.

56
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:42,461
And, um, I'm going to do the same exact thing.

57
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:48,779
I'm just gonna do the

58
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,442
framing and the composition in Photoshop.

59
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:03,081
Yeah, I think this is definitely going to be the best,

60
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:07,356
the best one. And then we potentially,

61
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:10,226
yeah,

62
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,230
this is actually going to be a really good thumbnail,

63
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,570
I think. Uhm,

64
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:19,171
we just need to, just need to

65
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:24,251
take his hand, do

66
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:27,300
this, layer via copy.

67
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:32,300
Oh

68
00:06:36,896 --> 00:07:23,983
yeah, this is better. I

69
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:27,849
think it's quite important here to really,

70
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,248
like, make sure the cutout looks great,

71
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:36,779
uh, just because again the

72
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,606
main idea is with the thumbnails is that we

73
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:46,940
don't want to make them look AI,

74
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:51,780
we just want to make it look as

75
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:56,967
if this guy has

76
00:07:56,968 --> 00:08:02,858
taken the photo in a exactly

77
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,434
this way. Alright, I'll clean this up and then get

78
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:13,669
back to you.

79
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,418
Alright, I

80
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,355
think it looks pretty good now. I'll just put it,

81
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:30,083
I think it can be a

82
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:30,947
bit bigger.

83
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,678
And now, from this photo,

84
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,460
I'll, First of all,

85
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:45,002
I want to remove this AC that he has.

86
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:52,461
Just because it's annoying. Should

87
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:54,799
be very easy with AI.

88
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,145
Brilliant. And,

89
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:03,211
uh, oops. And then,

90
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,486
I'll just remove his hand as well.

91
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:10,486
That's

92
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:26,065
pretty ugly, but it works.

93
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,957
Okay, so,

94
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,433
yeah, we have his hand over here.

95
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,979
And, uh,

96
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,547
I want him to be positioned.

97
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,830
This way. Let me maybe, kind of,

98
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:50,248
like, do this. I think this

99
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:53,497
looks really good.

100
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:55,693
Uh,

101
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,380
what I'll do right now is,

102
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:06,183
Well, I'll just, I'll just do this,

103
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,860
and then I'll add this to

104
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,864
the selection, and I'll do Generative Fill.

105
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:13,285
And at this point, the photo is basically ready.

106
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,554
This is gonna be,

107
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:32,224
I would say, like, version 1.

108
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,190
Yeah, I like this one the best. Uh,

109
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:40,709
maybe it's a bit too much

110
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:45,623
space for text. Now that I think about

111
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:57,252
it, maybe, Maybe

112
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:17,696
not. Okay, I'll export this. This

113
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:26,382
is going to be our, let's say, V1.

114
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:32,424
Now, I just want to experiment a little

115
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:43,511
bit. I wanna, try

116
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:45,991
this, and then,

117
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:50,650
yeah, it's a bit annoying because the masking

118
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:55,480
isn't gonna be good again. So I would need to tweak it again.

119
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:00,480
Yeah,

120
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,826
maybe we just leave this.

121
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:04,509
Because I wanted to try moving him,

122
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:08,824
like, closer to the middle.

123
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:14,939
But then,

124
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,525
I don't

125
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:24,876
know how

126
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:30,994
to do this

127
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:32,760
in Photoshop.

128
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:47,563
I guess I can just do this, right? Does that look good?

129
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:54,078
I think so. Let me just clean up this

130
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:10,099
a tiny bit. Alright,

131
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,756
so this is gonna be our v2.

132
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:18,606
These aren't crazy different, so it's not like we're gonna be split testing

133
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:23,431
these. We're just gonna see which one turns

134
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:28,580
out better. And then for the split

135
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:33,250
test, what I wanna

136
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,759
try is, potentially, just like.

137
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:54,775
this, where it's not gonna have any text.

138
00:14:56,122 --> 00:15:00,843
It's gonna be centered. Let's make

139
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:03,045
sure that it's centered. I think it is.

140
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:05,055
Uh, because, yeah,

141
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:09,073
it looks pretty good. We obviously need to remove this,

142
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:16,781
ugly. Ugly hands.

143
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:20,801
I would say,

144
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,080
I would say

145
00:15:28,801 --> 00:16:10,794
I want to remove. Nice,

146
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,121
now we should be able to,

147
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:17,217
yeah, grab his hand like this.

148
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:22,217
Again,

149
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,534
it's a bit annoying that I'm, like,

150
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:29,527
literally all of this is because he has no has just taken the photo

151
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:33,005
in a bit of a suboptimal way.

152
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:33,909
But, I think it will make the thumbnail

153
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,079
And it shouldn't be,

154
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:01,126
Yeah, I guess, honestly, this might be un-Photoshopable.

155
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:03,264
Or at least, at least,

156
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:06,182
you know, I'm just not, not that good at Photoshop.

157
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:12,516
Yeah, I think it's gonna, it's, it looks ugly.

158
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:16,265
Okay. Then,

159
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:23,852
I guess, let's just roll with the

160
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:27,109
regular one. Uh,

161
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,407
what I'll do here in Photoshop, though,

162
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:32,098
is I'll just make sure that,

163
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,552
oh, I wish his hand was closer.

164
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:54,724
But I think this is a good A-B test.

165
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:07,619
If we just have it with no,

166
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,550
no text, no nothing. So let

167
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:17,999
me do this real quick and then I

168
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,854
would like to I'm

169
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:29,460
gonna leave this small bit but then I

170
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,506
want to remove this window.

171
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,703
And hopefully this is something.

172
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,488
Oops, I did it wrong.

173
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,592
Hopefully this is something AI

174
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:52,794
can do. Let's see.

175
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:56,877
This is pretty perfect.

176
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:57,655
Wait,

177
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:05,374
why did it?

178
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:13,798
Okay, because I didn't select it.

179
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,978
Let me. Make sure. Make sure that I don't select any of this.

180
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,177
And then I'll select this.

181
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:26,736
Should be pretty good now.

182
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:41,684
Alright, whatever. It generates this small bit,

183
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:44,552
but I don't think it matters that much. So,

184
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:47,196
uhm,

185
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:50,507
now this is going to be our V3. And basically,

186
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:54,975
yeah, we will do, we'll do two,

187
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,971
We'll do an A-B test of two thumbnails,

188
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,992
the version one,

189
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,277
the main version

190
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,450
is going to be this photo,

191
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:21,901
just because it looks better than this one.

192
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,289
Yeah, this one definitely looks better.

193
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,280
Maybe we can, now I'm starting to,

194
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:31,918
to think that it's too close, which it probably

195
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,767
is. Oh,

196
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:39,341
but I, I literally removed everything.

197
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:41,914
That's not ideal.

198
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,780
Wait,

199
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:56,054
let me try. I want to have

200
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:06,790
it a bit closer to the center.

201
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:12,238
So, potentially,

202
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,403
like this.

203
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:43,902
Okay,

204
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,013
yeah, I like this. Uh,

205
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:48,460
this is gonna be, I mean,

206
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:52,789
I'll name it, V4 But basically,

207
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:59,060
right now, finally, let's go to Canva and we're gonna have this

208
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:02,342
Let me just show you the difference. So,

209
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:06,788
this is the one that's, I think is the best Here it's his way

210
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:12,348
too far to the left and the hand doesn't look that good And

211
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:17,626
if we compare these two, we just moved him closer to

212
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,192
the left But honestly, what happens,

213
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:24,401
What might happen is we're just gonna find out right now that it's actually

214
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:28,938
better to have him closer on the left And then we'll use the

215
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:35,122
other one. But for now, let's try this one And

216
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:41,487
so what I'll do is I'll just copy the text And

217
00:22:41,488 --> 00:23:47,747
the arrow, the everything Yeah,

218
00:23:47,748 --> 00:23:51,359
I like this more, because then we can make the text bigger.

219
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,468
This is why it's nice to have,

220
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:58,616
you know, a few variations.

221
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:03,616
Sorry,

222
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:13,020
one sec. Okay,

223
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:16,155
uhm,

224
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:21,912
yeah, the text is a bit, I

225
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:24,204
don't know, it seems a bit rotated.

226
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:34,434
I guess, I guess it's okay. Yeah,

227
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:36,803
I was saying that, that's why it's nice to have,

228
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:42,902
you know, just a few options for you to play around with,

229
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:47,069
in terms of the composition, like, here you can tell that this composition is

230
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,158
a lot better, just because we can actually fit in this text on screen

231
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,653
properly. So, uh,

232
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:56,638
I'll just remove that one, uh,

233
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:59,239
for the, yeah, for the arrow,

234
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,310
I quite like making it,

235
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,698
or I guess we're, we're gonna color, uh,

236
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:07,440
correct the screenshot and then we'll make the arrow.

237
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:11,746
For now, we'll just put it here, and now let's,

238
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:14,371
let's color grade. So,

239
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:20,355
let's see what this does.

240
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:25,036
It's okay. Let's do the BG remover

241
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:29,157
thing, and now we'll definitely add the shadow here

242
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:42,192
and here we need to yeah,

243
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:44,585
we need to add contrast, but not so much.

244
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:49,585
I

245
00:26:31,067 --> 00:27:21,784
think it's better in this case. Yeah,

246
00:27:21,785 --> 00:28:12,873
it's just not moving. Let's

247
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,785
create it in Photoshop. Wait one sec. Okay.

248
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:31,007
Just because his lighting isn't ideal.

249
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:33,377
And what I don't like here is that it,

250
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,928
like, it makes his screen overexposed.

251
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:40,720
And so I think it makes it a tiny bit worse.

252
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:45,720
Wait,

253
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:58,829
what the hell happens? I just wanna see,

254
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,199
I just wanna see, like, a difference.

255
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:28,352
Maybe I'm overthinking it, I don't know, maybe this is as good as it

256
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:31,631
can get. Because yeah,

257
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:33,763
his lighting definitely isn't ideal.

258
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:38,763
Nah,

259
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,815
I think it's actually a lot better in Photoshop.

260
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,263
His, uh, his background here is too much.

261
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:25,125
But it's okay, just because we're gonna separate that anyway.

262
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:28,875
So it's not a big of a deal.

263
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:33,875
Let

264
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:39,654
me save this. V2.

265
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:43,734
Upgrade it.

266
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:57,182
Let me just try how it is.

267
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:02,582
Yeah, I'd say it's much better.

268
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:07,582
If

269
00:32:11,705 --> 00:32:19,296
you compare these two,

270
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:22,066
maybe I added a bit too much,

271
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:28,651
like, effects in Photoshop in terms of the

272
00:32:28,652 --> 00:32:30,991
haze or whatever. Whatever it's called, and, like,

273
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:35,101
texture, but that's okay, I think. Uhm,

274
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:37,122
now finally, let's just grab this color.

275
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,547
Maybe,

276
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:44,802
maybe the other

277
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:46,888
way around?

278
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:53,259
I'll make, I'll make it like this.

279
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,259
Okay,

280
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:12,386
where

281
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:28,732
is it? Is it here?

282
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:41,387
That's it. Let's do the same thing with,

283
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,662
I don't know how to use Photoshop. Okay, perfect. I can do this. Nice.

284
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,402
No, it's not this one.

285
00:33:56,662 --> 00:34:01,495
I need this one for the AB

286
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:16,066
test. Yeah,

287
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:20,894
I think it's too much. I overdid

288
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:23,122
it a little bit on the previous one.

289
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,390
I'll keep it like this. And then I'll not, not add as much of

290
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,853
these effects. Yeah.

291
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,163
Okay,

292
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:01,133
that's pretty good. And now we should be able to just put this into

293
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:07,383
Canva. Yeah, this thumbnail

294
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:13,912
actually looks pretty

295
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:29,507
good. Here

296
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:32,977
in Canva, we just need to do BG remover.

297
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:38,692
And then I think we can copy style from here on to here.

298
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:43,106
And then we can paste. Paste this as well.

299
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:48,693
And maybe it needs more.

300
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:53,136
Yup. And it needs more shadows.

301
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:58,136
Think

302
00:36:57,996 --> 00:37:01,594
this is pretty good. One last thing I want to try,

303
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:07,407
just because on this thumbnail per day I

304
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:10,560
actually ended up outperforming everything in the,

305
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,908
in the A-B test.

306
00:37:13,957 --> 00:37:17,928
So let me see if we divide 16 by 2.

307
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:21,652
30, 53 bucks,

308
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:24,978
or 500,

309
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:28,752
whatever, 533.

310
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:33,752
Let

311
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,482
me make a duplicate text here.

312
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:53,482
Okay.

313
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:20,399
Can make this text a bit bigger.

314
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:14,300
All right, perfect. I think this is it.

315
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:18,283
I'm gonna test out all three.

316
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:20,320
And, uh, yeah,

317
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,454
that's it for this thumbnail.
