1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:04,551
Okay, here, we'll follow the same exact process.

2
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:06,992
So, usually,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,044
yeah, honestly, the main thing is just,

4
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:13,679
like, the composition. When you get the composition right,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,301
the thumbnail looks so much better. Here,

6
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:22,516
the same exact thing. I would love to have his thumb higher.

7
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:26,985
That's It's kind of like the problem with, With the thumbnails always,

8
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,701
just because when you're taking the photo in real life,

9
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:34,947
it feels super weird to lift your thumb higher.

10
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,902
But on the thumbnail, it actually looks better.

11
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:44,937
So, I have a few thoughts here. First of all,

12
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:52,907
I have a cool idea. Or

13
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:55,311
maybe this isn't a cool idea,

14
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:58,350
but at least it's an idea.

15
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:03,350
Because,

16
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:08,244
you know, see how he has text on his screen?

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,203
So, if it wasn't this text-heavy,

18
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:14,412
I would just kind of, like, do this,

19
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,046
and then I would say 34k per month if he didn't have that, or

20
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:21,620
17k per month,

21
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,543
whatever

22
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:36,267
he makes, if he didn't have,

23
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:38,559
That text on the,

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,914
on the screen, but with the text, it just looks a little bit too

25
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:47,563
busy. So what I'm thinking,

26
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:52,339
I know what we'll do, but we need Photoshop for this again.

27
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,811
We'll do this in Photoshop though, it's gonna be worth it.

28
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,599
I think this is gonna be gonna turn out really good.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,883
Uhm,

30
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:08,358
yeah, honestly, getting the composition right is,

31
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:13,273
And I just can't find this thumbnail now.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,410
Getting the composition right,

33
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:21,692
I don't even need this Anymore?

34
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:24,405
I don't think so. Let me save it just in case.

35
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:29,246
Uhm,

36
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:34,497
getting the composition right really is the biggest challenge.

37
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,676
But, once you do get it right,

38
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:43,378
the thumbnail just becomes so much better.

39
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:46,603
And Photoshop, truthfully, is a lot better for this.

40
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:50,464
Uh, and, uhm, and you'll see right now why.

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,891
So what I wanna do, is I wanna,

42
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,977
What's a nice scale, you think?

43
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,708
I think it's something like this.

44
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:17,043
Potentially even having it

45
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:20,023
like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is gonna look really cool.

46
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,399
Okay, nice. And now we'll do a bunch of masking.

47
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,342
So, what we need to do first,

48
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:34,236
is we need to, Honestly,

49
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,587
remove the guy.

50
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:40,324
I probably should have done it from the very beginning,

51
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:44,540
but that's okay. We need to remove the guy,

52
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,319
and it's definitely not gonna be ideal.

53
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:50,063
Honestly, if I just, like, select subject.

54
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:53,870
Uh,

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,130
I'll deselect all this.

56
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:05,651
Perfect.

57
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:08,537
Uhm, can I,

58
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,978
see, I don't know how to use Photoshop.

59
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:18,740
I just wanna, like, exp-, maybe select and mask.

60
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:24,715
Yeah, now it's just not working. Nice.

61
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,107
Dude,

62
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:32,847
what the hell,

63
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:38,108
what the hell

64
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:42,414
happened?

65
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,493
I couldn't, I didn't have a chance to, like,

66
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:47,515
select anything. Okay. Yeah,

67
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:53,358
so I'll Shift-Edge. And this definitely

68
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,650
doesn't help that much. Okay,

69
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:07,091
whatever, I'll just, I'll just press Remove and hope for the best.

70
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:11,323
I don't know what, what it's going to come up with.

71
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,334
Hopefully something. Something half decent,

72
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,262
probably. Oh shit,

73
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:21,042
this is perfect. Wait,

74
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,101
this is literally all we need. Okay.

75
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,451
Oh, but now it's annoying because.

76
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:36,283
Ah, yeah, see this is what happens when you have no idea what you're

77
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:44,105
doing. Sorry about

78
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:48,655
this. Okay.

79
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:52,873
You know what? I'll just,

80
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:56,402
I'll just. Start from scratch.

81
00:05:56,403 --> 00:06:00,976
I think this is going to be better. So.

82
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,272
So I'll open this.

83
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,963
Yeah, see, I don't even know,

84
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:13,227
like, how to start a new thing. Can

85
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,028
I f******. Did one sec.

86
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:21,298
Okay, never mind. This Photoshop AI is so good.

87
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:24,464
I don't even need to do any of that. It literally did this,

88
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:27,751
which is pretty cool. F****** crazy. All right,

89
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:30,437
so we have this, which is an awesome start.

90
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:34,937
Now, my plan is to move this.

91
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:44,413
Yeah, I need, I need to, I need to select the guy here on

92
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:48,384
this layer. Uhm,

93
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,749
I don't need to say it. Select the monitor.

94
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,709
My plan is to basically move the monitor down,

95
00:06:57,097 --> 00:07:02,330
and like the background down, so that we have space

96
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:07,315
on top to put the 17k

97
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:10,369
per month and whatnot text.

98
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,369
Is

99
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:22,594
this good? I think so.

100
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:28,153
All right, so we don't need this. We need to move this

101
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:32,339
down. Like that.

102
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,227
How much down?

103
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:39,349
Probably like this.

104
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:46,290
Just so you can tell that it's a monitor.

105
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:51,322
But we have space to put 17k per month there on top.

106
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:54,456
Okay, uh,

107
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:59,947
now let me figure out how to, uhm,

108
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,018
think about I just,

109
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,837
I think I, hopefully I can just do this and do Generative Fill and

110
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,098
then just like generate

111
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:18,744
Yeah, this is kind of the thing about Photoshop versus Canva is Photoshop Generative

112
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:23,502
Fill is so much better and also Canva doesn't have masking.

113
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:28,466
At least I don't know about it. Alright,

114
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:33,255
this is good, and now the final touch of

115
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:36,057
all this is I want his thumb.

116
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:41,356
So I'll go ahead, I'll duplicate the,

117
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,569
I'll duplicate the initial layer,

118
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,627
I'll move it bit up, I'll just, select,

119
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,676
I can select his whole hand.

120
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,874
Perfect. Yeah,

121
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,607
see how much better it looks when he's,

122
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:05,380
like, I wish, I wish, I wish they would know that while taking

123
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,963
the thumbnail, but you, you just never know.

124
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,588
And it's, you know, it's understandable.

125
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,703
and On this thing,

126
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:18,222
I'll just remove it.

127
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:23,851
The only thing is, should have done it before

128
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:32,114
this. Let's

129
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,311
see what it comes up with. Maybe it's,

130
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:37,547
again, maybe I'm just underestimating how good it is.

131
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:40,289
Holy shit,

132
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,999
I, uhm, I didn't think that it would draw his exact,

133
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,356
like, edge of his body. Oh my god,

134
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,479
it's so good. It's insane.

135
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,209
It's insane. Alright,

136
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,821
now we're done. That's it.

137
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:58,126
I don't want to blur this, although,

138
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,171
maybe just like a tiny bit. Thank Let's see.

139
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,890
Yeah, nah, because it's on the same distance from the

140
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:14,174
camera as his face. So,

141
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:19,214
we don't want to blur it, we just want to export as

142
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:22,224
JPEG, quality high.

143
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,675
And, uhm, I'll save it as is.

144
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:29,337
Cool.

145
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,944
And now, yeah,

146
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:34,796
and by the way, just to show you the difference,

147
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:40,137
why we did all that is because we went from this to this.

148
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,485
And this is so much better composition-wise.

149
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:48,006
And, still, what's, by the way, what's so important,

150
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:50,911
okay, because Pat mentioned it, Pat mentioned this a bunch of times,

151
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:53,572
is, like, we don't want to make stuff look AI.

152
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:58,071
So, if you imagine, this is still,

153
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:01,739
this still looks very realistic. Like, you can take a photo like that,

154
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,394
it's just his camera wasn't positioned ideally,

155
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,808
which is a fair point. Like,

156
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,106
you, you never know while taking the photo.

157
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,803
So, you ideally want to fix that in post.

158
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:18,531
But it makes composition so much better.

159
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:23,073
Like, we, you know, here I

160
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:26,272
can't really do anything. If I want to follow my idea of,

161
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:28,384
okay, I want to put text here on the top,

162
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:32,664
I need to have the guy that low and then I can't see his

163
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:34,791
thumb. Which, I guess, honestly,

164
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,867
it's okay if I just remove his thumb.

165
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,078
His thumb from here.

166
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:49,047
This is actually not bad at all.

167
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,208
Maybe I should just remove his thumb because his thumb

168
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,981
is kind of annoying. Maybe I should move it lower.

169
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:03,940
Yeah, so that it's a bit less. Maybe I should make this a bit

170
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:08,534
lower as well. I'll move this a bit

171
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:12,851
lower. Uhm,

172
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:18,860
but again,

173
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:21,181
if you don't want to mess around with it that much,

174
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,132
then I guess you can just position it like this. Then the guy is

175
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,995
a bit lower than ideally I would want.

176
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,012
I don't want to have it personally, but at least you have space on

177
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,733
the top to put the text there.

178
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:35,057
And then you obviously just, like, remove his thumb and you can do this

179
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:38,197
in Canva. So, this would be super possible in Canva.

180
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,529
Canva would remove this thumb easily.

181
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:43,086
And then you would just generate the,

182
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,112
uhm,

183
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:45,922
like, the border.

184
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:53,380
But now, since we already went through all this,

185
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:57,933
let me just real quick generate this

186
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:00,326
and we'll finally finalize this,

187
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:05,001
uh, this in Canva. Finalizing in Canva is

188
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,086
much easier than in Photoshop. Uh,

189
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,101
this is kind of like my workflow in general,

190
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:13,765
is you wanna, if you wanna mess around with

191
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:18,351
composition, like this, then you do it in Photoshop.

192
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,926
And then, in terms of adding the text and stuff like that,

193
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:29,129
you just do it in Canva, because it's just, it's just easier and

194
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,160
faster. And honestly, the result,

195
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,917
maybe it's because I don't know how to use Photoshop again.

196
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:40,340
But, That's

197
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:45,490
the way I do it. So, I'll

198
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,755
import this. Perfect.

199
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:54,503
Uh, I'll do the color correction right away.

200
00:13:54,986 --> 00:14:02,898
Let me just do, I

201
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,092
don't like it, because it washed it out,

202
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:09,237
so I'll, I'll separate it.

203
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,468
Although, maybe I'm just being lazy.

204
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,512
I just need to, just need to not let it wash it out.

205
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:22,941
Yeah,

206
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:29,799
it's gonna,

207
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,971
it's gonna

208
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:41,459
be better

209
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,016
now that I separate it.

210
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:50,016
Let

211
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:59,479
me copy the thing.

212
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,678
I don't wanna darken the monitor by too much.

213
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:17,297
Since it's kind of like,

214
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,734
you know, a part of the thumbnail.

215
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:33,719
What I'll do now is,

216
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:42,096
yeah, I'll just copy this text. I'll

217
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:44,748
put, per month, I think,

218
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:49,866
on top of the monitor, maybe like here.

219
00:15:50,764 --> 00:16:01,736
Yep. And-

220
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,018
It says 17k, and again,

221
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:08,877
the font is just annoying.

222
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:09,224
going.

223
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:30,905
I'll make this as big as I can,

224
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:35,102
really. This is pretty good.

225
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:43,449
Hmm. Per month doesn't fit.

226
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,395
What I would do in these scenarios is I would usually just make it

227
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,699
MRR instead.

228
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,688
Like this.

229
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:58,850
Ooh, this is good. I love this.

230
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,001
Okay. So then the last thing,

231
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:09,480
I'm just gonna

232
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:15,967
make sure this is, Align

233
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:20,917
like this nicely. Essentially,

234
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,366
nah, it doesn't need to be bigger. I'm just gonna put it on top

235
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,911
of the monitor like that. And then,

236
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,928
yeah, MRR is gonna be here,

237
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:32,440
let's see. I think,

238
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:41,061
I want to have MRR there.

239
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,147
And because of that,

240
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,349
I'm gonna make this text a bit bigger.

241
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:58,082
And now I'm starting to think that the monitor should be shaded a bit

242
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:02,891
more. Or,

243
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:05,101
Maybe I should just wash it out more.

244
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,512
If I go to,

245
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:13,950
which one is it? This one. And I'll bring down the

246
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:15,080
white.

247
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:23,898
So that this text on the monitor doesn't,

248
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:30,894
you know. No. Interferes with this white text

249
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,504
enama. I'm also starting to think that,

250
00:18:35,556 --> 00:18:39,208
it was better like this to create more separation kind of.

251
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:44,717
Cause you don't, you don't want this text that you've added and then text

252
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:51,019
from the monitor to clash. Yeah.

253
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,380
Cool. Now,

254
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:55,488
the shadow needs a bit of tweaking. Let's see what's happening.

255
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:00,254
Wait, which direction should it be?

256
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:11,404
Like this, right? Probably minus forty-five,

257
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:23,500
yeah. Alright. Cool.

258
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:26,656
And I would say this needs a bit less.

259
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:30,164
Although, nah, it was actually good.

260
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:35,964
Sweet. Uh, the,

261
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:42,445
the last thing. Is an arrow.

262
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:48,471
We can reuse this arrow. But what we want to do for this arrow

263
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:53,316
is, I would really make it,

264
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:58,316
umm,

265
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:02,555
I would grab this color. Nope,

266
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:04,873
it should be, the other way around.

267
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:16,931
And potentially make this,

268
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:32,615
this should be white. All right. Like that.

269
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:43,287
I like this more.

270
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:48,287
Yeah,

271
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:58,681
this is better. Uh, maybe honestly, instead of this purple, I should- . Nah,

272
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:01,777
purple, purple is cool. Uh,

273
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:05,181
awesome. Think that's it.

274
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,056
Just to quickly recap, Composition is the main thing.

275
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:13,611
And then really just wrapping it up,

276
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:18,329
making sure that, The subject and the text stand

277
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,646
out. Here, actually, I like,

278
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,467
I like more when it's shaded. You still

279
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:30,071
can't tell that this is a monitor. Maybe a bit less,

280
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:33,101
like that. But you still can't tell that this is a monitor,

281
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,850
which is the main thing. Mmm.

282
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:37,707
And yeah, that's it, we do.
