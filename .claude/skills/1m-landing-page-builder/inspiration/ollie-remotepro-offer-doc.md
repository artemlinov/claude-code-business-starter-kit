## Section 5: What Are We Focusing On?

- Three fundamental bottlenecks identified:
  1. Rigid or complex offer that doesn't scale
  2. Getting attention and building authority
  3. Converting leads to high-paying clients
- Three pillars to address them:
  1. **Entice** — content that drives attention + builds authority
  2. **Enrol** — predictably converting leads into customers
  3. **Empower** — results delivery system for client transformation
- Social proof screenshot between sections
- Transition hook: "What are the outcomes of working together? ↓"

  1. OFFER — Your Micro-Offer Stack
  2. MODEL — The Client Ecosystem
  3. LEADS — Coal For Your Contents Fire
- Embedded video explaining the model
- **Each outcome gets its own detailed sub-section:**

### 1. OFFER — Your Micro-Offer Stack

- What it is: "$2k+ offer with one simple promise"
- Outcome line: "quickly validate your offer so you can put cash into your bank account"

### 2. MODEL — The Client Ecosystem
- Strategy: "ascend strangers > followers > leads > customers > clients > testimonials"
- Key insight: "funnels are out and ecosystems are in"

- Outcome line: "build a predictable future-proofed Trust Machine"

### 3. LEADS — Growth Tax Ads

---

## Section 9: The Effort (Time Commitment + Expectation Setting)

- Honest: "unlike other coaches I'm not going to tell you there isn't plenty of work to get done"
- Airplane metaphor: "A huge amount of energy is required to get a plane to take off... much less is required to keep it in the air."
- Specific time ask: "3-5 hours/week to dedicate this over the next few months"
- Bold promise: "by the end of the 12 months, you'll be pulling in more money than you ever have in your life"

## Section 10: FAQ

- Embedded YouTube video (7:48) answering common questions

---

## Section 11: The Investment (Multiple Payment Options + Stress vs Stretch)

- Framing: "introductory offer for Founding Members only"
- Cap: "community will be capped at 90 members total"
- **Multiple payment structures:**
  - 3 x Monthly Payments of $X
  - 7 x Monthly Payments of $X
  - Pre-pay in full and save 29%
- Different pricing for different years (2025 vs 2026)
- ROI framing: "The aim is your first 1-2 clients covers your entire investment"
- Speed: "Typically our members make their full investment back within the first 30-90 days"
- 10x goal: "The intended outcome for the year is that you more than 10x your investment"
- **"I can't afford it" handling — Stress vs Stretch concept:**
  - **Stress Investment** — "if it's going to keep you up at night... don't do it"
  - **Stretch Investment** — "something that stretches you and forces you to level up"
- Personal story: "Every investment I've made in myself, I could have easily said 'I can't afford it' — but I figured out a way to make it happen anyway."
- Long-term framing: "I want to work with you for YEARS. But first... we start with one year."

## Section 12: Guarantee (Reframe)

- Bold positioning: "a guarantee that is frankly really uncommon in the online education space"
- The guarantee: "if you don't do the work, you won't get the outcome"
- Reframe who needs guarantees: "People that need a guarantee are looking for someone else to save them."
- Personal: "I've NEVER expected a guarantee with mentors and coaches I've invested in."

## Key Structural Patterns to Reuse

1. **Invitation framing** — "Your invitation to join us" not "Buy now"
2. **Section transition hooks** — Every section ends with a teaser + ↓ arrow
3. **Qualification early** — Who it's for/not for appears in section 3 (before selling)
4. **Named frameworks with implied TM** — builds perceived value
5. **Bold keyword: description** format for "who it's for" lists
6. **Authority quotes** to back up methodology
7. **Stress vs Stretch** investment reframe
8. **Multiple payment structures** with savings incentive
9. **Case study group framing** — makes joining feel collaborative, not transactional
10. **Guarantee reframe** — turns the objection into a qualification filter
11. **Embedded video** for FAQ and testimonials (reduces text, builds trust)
12. **Social proof scattered throughout** — not just one section, but screenshots between sections
13. **Phased timeline** — shows the journey, reduces overwhelm
14. **Effort section** — sets honest expectations, filters out tire-kickers
