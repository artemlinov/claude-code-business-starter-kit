## Inputs

Gather before writing:

1. **What's being sold:** Offer, program, or action
2. **Copy destination:** Email, checkout page, sales page, offer doc, or other
3. **Audience state:** What do they know? What just happened? What's next?
4. **Primary action:** What's the ONE thing they should do after reading?
5. **Context:** Position in sequence (if email), page structure (if page), any additional context the user provides

If any input is missing, ask before writing.

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Destination

Ask or infer where this copy will live. This determines which rules to apply.

| Destination | Load | Key Differences |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| **Email** | Email-specific rules (below) | No bold, no bullets, single CTA, subject + preview |
| **Landing page** | Page-specific rules (below) | Bold headers OK, lists OK, repeated CTAs, visual hierarchy |

### Step 2: Apply Shared Copy Principles

These apply to ALL copy regardless of destination.

**Voice:**
- Direct, conversational, thinking out loud
- 1-3 sentence paragraphs, one thought per paragraph
- Contractions: gonna, wanna, it's
- Conversational interjections as transitions ("Solid, right??", "And here's the thing:")
- Cut aggressively — every draft is too long on the first pass

**Conversion Patterns:**

*The Thinking Out Loud Structure:*
1. State something direct
2. Add context or a question
3. Answer or reframe
4. Connect to the reader
5. Clear ask

*Reframes That Convert:*

"What has actually changed?"
```
What has actually changed in the past 6 months?

Not what you've tried. Not what you've learned. What has actually changed in your income, your clients, your situation?
```

"What happens if nothing changes?"
```
What happens if nothing changes?

If you're in the exact same position 6 months from now.

Same income. Same clients. Same frustrations.

→ What does that actually cost you?
```

"Difficult questions = real progress"
```
I'm not asking this to pressure you.

I'm asking because difficult questions are where the real progress is made.
```

**Urgency (Ethical Only):**

✓ "What's another 6 months of being stuck costing you?"
✓ "The sooner you start, the sooner you're at $5K/month"
✓ "If you're gonna do this eventually, might as well start now"
✓ Real scarcity when true (e.g., "10 spots because I personally review every edit")

✗ "Only 3 spots left!" (unless actually true)
✗ "This offer expires tonight!" (fake deadlines)
✗ Pressure tactics
✗ Hype words: amazing, incredible, life-changing

## Email-Specific Rules

Apply these ONLY when writing email copy.

### Structural Rules

**Greetings:**
- First email in sequence: `Hey {{name}},`
- Follow-up emails: `{{name}},` (no "Hey")

**Paragraphs:**
- 1-3 sentences max per paragraph
- One thought per paragraph
- Generous whitespace

**Lists:**
- 3-5 items max
- One item per line
- NO bullet points or dashes — just line breaks

**Emphasis:**
- Use `→` before the primary CTA (ONE per email max)
- NO bold in email body
- Use spacing for emphasis instead

**Sign-offs:**
- In sequences: "Talk [day of week]." where [day] = the weekday the next email sends
- Standalone emails: "Looking forward to it." / "Talk soon." / "See you tomorrow."
- Always just "Artem" (no dash)

### Rhythm & Pacing

1. **One sentence per line.** Break compound sentences apart.
2. **Use ellipsis (...)** for trailing thoughts. 1-2 per email max.
3. **Use conversational interjections as transitions:** "The second type though?" / "Solid, right??" / "And here's the craziest part:"
4. **Colons before lists/explanations.** "Here's what I mean:" not "Here's what I mean."
5. **Never echo subject/preview in the opening.** Jump straight into content.
6. **Cut aggressively.** Remove setup sentences, transition phrases, repeated conclusions.
7. **Double question marks** ("??") for rhetorical emphasis.

### Subject Lines

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Direct question | "Quick question before our call" |
| Specific number | "The $2K/video question" |
| Curiosity gap | "One thing I forgot to mention" |
| Time-based | "12 hours from now" |
| Pattern interrupt | "This might sound weird" |

Subject lines: 4-8 words, lowercase (unless proper noun), no periods, personal not promotional.

### Preview Text

- 40-90 characters
- Complements subject line (doesn't repeat it)
- Creates curiosity or continues the thought
- Written as a fragment, not a complete sentence

### Email Output Format

```
**Subject:** [subject line]
**Preview:** [preview text]

---

[Email body]
```

### Sequence Rules

- Don't repeat offer details covered in earlier emails. Each email adds NEW information or a new angle.
- When a checkout/landing page exists, make that the primary CTA. Don't use "reply and I'll send the link" when the link exists.
- First mention of a program's price should use the full program name. After that, shorthand is fine.

## Page-Specific Rules

Apply these when writing copy for landing pages, checkout pages, sales pages, or offer docs.

### What Changes for Pages

- **Bold headers OK** — use for section titles and sub-items
- **Structured lists OK** — for "what's included" sections
- **CTA repeated 2-3 times** — hero, after investment section, final section
- **Visual hierarchy** — use H1/H2/H3 to create scannable structure
- **Longer format OK** — pages can be comprehensive
- **"How to Join" section** — numbered steps to make action feel simple
- **Investment framing** — ROI math + price objection handling on-page

### Conversion Flow

Progressive reveal: Problem → Qualification → Solution → Details → Proof → Price → Action

Key patterns:
- **Qualification section early** — filter before selling. "This is for X. This is NOT for Y."
- **Named frameworks with ™** — builds perceived value
- **"The Investment" framing** — not just "Price"
- **Stress vs Stretch concept** — handle price objection by reframing what "expensive" means
- **Step-by-step "How to Join"** — makes action feel simple (3-4 numbered steps)
- **Testimonials after price** — reinforce after the investment section

### Page Type Reference

When the user specifies a page structure, adapt to it. Common types for reference:

| Type | Sections |
|------|----------|
| **Short checkout** | Hero → What's Included → CTA |
| **Medium hybrid** | Hero → What's Included → Who It's For/Not For → FAQ → CTA |
| **Full sales page** | Hero → Problem → Qualification → Solution → What's Included → Timeline → Social Proof → Investment → FAQ → How to Join → Final CTA |
| **Offer doc** | Hero Invitation → What Is This? → Qualification → Unique Mechanism → Focus Areas → Detailed Outcomes → Program Summary → Timeline → The Effort → FAQ → Investment → Guarantee → How to Join → Testimonials |

### Page Quality Checklist

- [ ] Sounds like Artem wrote it (not a marketer)
- [ ] Clear CTA repeated 2-3 times
- [ ] Uses bold headers and structured lists (page format, not email)
- [ ] 1-3 sentences per paragraph
- [ ] Qualification section appears early
- [ ] Price framed as "The Investment" with ROI math
- [ ] "How to Join" uses simple numbered steps
- [ ] Uses contractions
- [ ] Conversational interjections as transitions
- [ ] Draft has been cut — no filler
- [ ] No hype words
- [ ] No guru energy
- [ ] No fake scarcity or fake deadlines

## Examples

### Pre-Call Confirmation Email

**Subject:** just booked — quick video inside
**Preview:** 3 minutes, worth watching before we talk

---

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

You just booked a clarity call with me.

Here's the deal:

It's a quick 15-minute chat where I'm gonna ask you where you are right now, where you're trying to go, and what's holding you back.

I'm not gonna pitch you on anything. We're literally just figuring out if you're a good fit for Full-Time Editor.

Before we talk, I made a short video explaining what to expect and what kind of editor I work with.

→ Watch it here.

It's like 3 minutes. Worth it.

Your call:

{{appointment.start_time}}
{{appointment.meeting_location}}

Looking forward to it.

Artem

---

### Pre-Call Reminder Email (12 Hours Before)

**Subject:** 12 hours from now
**Preview:** one question to sit with before we talk

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Our call is in about 12 hours.

I want you to sit with one question:

What happens if nothing changes?

If you're in the exact same position 6 months from now.

Same income. Same clients. Same frustrations.

→ What does that actually cost you?

I'm not asking this to pressure you.

I'm asking because difficult questions are where the real progress is made.

Come ready to have a real conversation. Not a surface-level one.

That's all I ask.

Your call:

{{appointment.start_time}}
{{appointment.meeting_location}}

Talk soon.

Artem

---

### Reactivation Email

**Subject:** no pressure, just curious
**Preview:** noticed you went quiet

---

{{contact.first_name}},

I noticed you went quiet after we talked.

No pressure. Just curious what happened.

Did something change? Did you decide to go a different direction? Did life just get busy?

I'm not trying to sell you on anything. I'm genuinely asking because I want to know if there's something I missed or could have done better.

If Full-Time Editor isn't for you, that's totally fine. I'd rather know than wonder.

→ Hit reply and let me know where you're at.

Either way, I hope things are going well.

Artem
