# Tweet Writer

Transform source content into viral tweet variations for Full-Time Editor's audience of skilled-but-stuck video editors.

---

## Knowledge Dependencies

Before generating tweets, load:

- `.claude/knowledge/artem/voice-of-artem.md` — Core voice and tone
- `.claude/knowledge/artem/voice-of-artem-twitter.md` — Platform-specific patterns
- `.claude/knowledge/full-time-editor/ideal-customer-profile.md` — Target audience
- `.claude/knowledge/full-time-editor/fte-framework-definitions.md` — Framework names with ™
- `.claude/knowledge/full-time-editor/full-time-editor-manifesto.md` — Brand beliefs and enemies

---

## Process

### Step 1: Extract Core Insights

Identify 3-5 standalone ideas from source content. Each insight must work as its own tweet — don't follow source structure.

### Step 2: Generate Tweet Variations

Create 8-12 variations using proven structures. Each tweet must:

- Be under 280 characters (hard limit)
- Hook in first line
- Include specific numbers or concrete details
- End with a memorable bar
- Work standalone (no source context needed)

### Step 3: Format Output

For each tweet:

```
**Tweet [Number] – [Structure Name]**

\`\`\`
[Tweet text]
\`\`\`

**Character count:** [X]
**Why it works:** [1 sentence]
```

### Step 4: Recommend Best

Identify strongest 3-4 tweets with brief reasoning.

---

## Output

**Location:** `content/social/twitter/`
**Format:** Markdown file with all variations

---

## Formatting Rules

### Character Limit
Every tweet under 280 characters. Count before presenting.

### Bullets
- Use `–` (medium dash) for bullet lists
- Use numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) ONLY for sequential processes
- Never use `*` or `-`

### Numbers
- Use $5K not $5,000
- Always specific: $2.5K, 18 months, 40 hours/week

### Structure
- Generous line breaks between thoughts
- Single-line statements hit harder
- Ladder format for lists: shortest → longest

## Proven Tweet Structures

### 1. The Contrarian Flip

```
Most editors think:

[Common belief].

Reality:

– [Truth 1]
– [Truth 2]
– [Truth 3]

[Bar].
```

### 2. The Dichotomy

```
[Type A] editors [do X].
[Type B] editors [do Y].

[Type A]: [detail]
[Type B]: [detail]

[Bar implying which is better].
```

### 3. The Personal Story Arc

```
[Date/time marker].

[Setup – 1-2 lines].
[Specific numbers/situation].

[Time skip]:

– [Result 1]
– [Result 2]
– [Result 3]

[Bar].
```

### 4. The Math Reframe

```
[Surprising equation].

[What it means].

[Bar].
```

### 5. The Direct Statement

```
[Bold claim].

[One-line support].

[Bar].
```

### 6. The Two Types Framework

```
There are two [types] of [thing].

1. [Name]: [description]
2. [Name]: [description]

[Bar about which matters].
```

### 7. The Reframe

```
[Thing everyone hates] is actually [positive reframe].

Most editors:
– [Wrong 1]
– [Wrong 2]

Smart editors:
– [Right 1]
– [Right 2]

[Bar].
```

### 8. The Process Framework

```
[Role], pay attention.

First, [phase 1]:
– [Item]
– [Item]

Then, [phase 2]:
– [Item]
– [Item]

Lastly, [phase 3]:
– [Item]
– [Item]

[Bar].
```

## Writing Strong Bars

The bar is the final line — quotable, screenshot-worthy.

**Math Bar:** Undeniable logic
- "Charge $2K/video, not $500."
- "$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25."

**Question Bar:** Makes them think
- "Which one are you?"
- "Guess which one has a ceiling."

**Identity Bar:** Defines who we are
- "That's Storytelling First™."
- "That's what leverage looks like."

**Contrast Bar:** Two paths, one line
- "Defensive editors get fired. Learning editors become irreplaceable."

**Decision Bar:** Forces choice
- "Choose your character."

**Outcome Bar:** Shows what happens
- "That's when rates go up."

## Elite Examples

These represent the gold standard:

### Example 1: Process Framework (10/10)

```
Video editors, pay attention.

First, you make it flow:

– Music
– Pacing
– Fine cut

Then, you make it clear:

– Story
– Graphics
– Digestibility

Lastly, you make it pop:

– SFX
– Effects
– Animations

In that order.
```

### Example 2: Personal Story Arc (10/10)

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing...

– $120/video
– $1,000/month (sometimes)
– 40 miserable hours per week

I was pissed off.
But kept going...

Eight months of Storytelling later:

– 1 dream client
– $2,000/video (weekly)
– 40 fulfilled hours per week

Story First.
```

### Example 3: Math Reframe (9.5/10)

```
$5K/month video editing is:

– 1 client, not 5
– 4 hours, not 12
– 5 videos, not 25

Quality > quantity.
```

### Example 4: Income Ladder (9/10)

```
Video editing in a nutshell:

$0-1K/month: you know software
$1-2K/month: you know consistency
$2-3K/month: you know shortcuts
$3-5K/month: you know branding
$5-7K/month: you know content
$7-10K/month: you know freedom

What a journey…
```

### Example 5: Contrarian Flip (8.5/10)

```
You're not bad at After Effects,

You're just skipping the boring stuff.

Don't start with:
– Effects
– Timings
– Animations

Start with:
– Colors
– Design
– Composition

Then animate what's already beautiful.

Most editors animate ugly scenes. Smart editors make static scenes stunning first.
```

### Example 6: Dichotomy (8.5/10)

```
Good video editors focus on the look of the video.
Great video editors focus on the feel of the video.

Look: deep glow, 3D animations, flashy backgrounds.
Feel: pacing, storytelling, sound design.
```

### Example 7: Direct Statement (8.5/10)

```
Video editors, keep this in mind:

Good animation can't save bad design,
Good design can save bad animation.
```

### Example 8: Personal Story (8.5/10)

```
My top 3 purchases as a video editor:

1. Adobe subscription
2. Macbook pro (16-inch)
3. One-way ticket to Southeast Asia

In that order.
```

## Critical Rules

### 1. Always Call Out Video Editors
Every tweet must make it immediately clear from the first line that it's for video editors. You don't necessarily need "Video editors" as the literal first two words, but the reader must know within the first line that this is about video editing. Reference editing, clients, timelines, videos, or the editor identity right away.

### 2. Always Under 280 Characters
This is a hard limit. No exceptions. Count characters before presenting. If a tweet is over 280 characters, cut it down or split the idea.

### 3. Confident, Never Cocky
Never write lines like "nobody else can," "better than anyone," or "like no one else." Artem's voice is confident but humble. Instead of claiming superiority, show it through specifics. List what you know (their channel, audience, business) rather than saying you know it "better than anyone."

### 4. Make It Actionable With Bullets
When giving advice, break it into specific items the reader can act on. Bullet lists with "their style, their story, their format" are more useful than abstract statements like "learn everything about them." Give the reader a checklist, not a vague instruction.

### 5. Natural Flow Over Rigid Structure
"Revisions are a cheat code for video editors" flows better than "Video editors, revisions are a cheat code." The rule is that the first line must make it clear the tweet is for editors, but the words "video editors" don't need to be forced into the opening position if the sentence reads better another way.

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting each tweet, verify:

- [ ] Under 280 characters (HARD LIMIT)
- [ ] Clear from the first line that this tweet is for video editors
- [ ] Strong hook in first line
- [ ] At least one specific number or concrete detail
- [ ] Uses – for bullets (not numbered unless sequential)
- [ ] Ends with memorable bar
- [ ] Works standalone
- [ ] Sounds like Artem, not AI

## Universal Principles (from Founder OS)

### The 4 C's for Content

1. **Curate** — Study what's working. Build swipe files.
2. **Create** — Batch content in focused sessions.
3. **Check** — Proofread. Mistakes kill reach.
4. **Circulate** — Schedule and distribute strategically.

### Hook Philosophy

You have 1.7 seconds. Hook types that work:

- **Intriguing Question** — Provokes curiosity
- **Shocking Statistic** — Unexpected data
- **Bold Statement** — Strong claim that sparks interest
- **The Teaser** — Glimpse without full reveal
- **The Promise** — Clear benefit for reading

### Writing Cadence

Vary sentence rhythm. Short sentences hit hard. Longer ones build context and add depth to your point. Then punch again.

**The Bar Concept:** End each tweet like a mic drop — quotable, hard-hitting, impossible to forget.

### Attention vs Connection

- **Attention content:** Broad appeal, viral potential, new audience
- **Connection content:** Specific to ICP, deeper engagement, business conversion

Balance both. Connection content drives business results.
