### Color Usage Rules

- **80-90% of frames stay neutral** — #0D0D0D background, #FFFFFF or #E5E5E5 text
- **Brand red (#CE0000) is earned, not default** — use it to mark key moments, not everywhere
- **Light red (#FFB0B0) for secondary emphasis** — when brand red would be too strong
- **Extended palette only for complex diagrams** — Venn diagrams, frameworks with multiple segments
- **Never use bright, saturated colors** — everything should feel muted and sophisticated

## Typography

### Fonts

| Role | Font | Usage |
|------|------|-------|
| Primary | TBD | Headlines, key text on screen |
| Secondary | TBD | Supporting text, smaller labels |
| Handwriting | Noteworthy | Annotations, personal notes, emphasis moments |

### Text Style Rules

- **No exclamation points**
- **No emojis**
- **No slang** (unless quoting)
- **No ALL CAPS for emphasis**
- **Rounded corners:** Subtle or none — nothing heavy

### Voice in Text

The text should sound like Alex — calm, confident, no hype.

**Do this:**
- "The key insight"
- "What most people miss"
- "Here's the framework"

**Don't do this:**
- "THIS IS HUGE!"
- "Let's gooo"
- "🔥🔥🔥"
- "Game-changer alert"

## Graphic Design Principles

### Stylization

**Approach:** Very light. Reality first, design second. Graphics should feel placed, not designed.

**Action items:**
- No drop shadows on text (or very subtle if absolutely needed)
- No black strokes
- No deep glows
- No heavy gradients
- If a graphic looks "designed," simplify it until it looks "placed"

### Animation Quantity

**Approach:** Minimal (A-roll heavy). Most of the video should be talking head. Only add graphics when there's a specific reason.

**Action items:**
- Add graphics to illustrate concepts, show data, or visualize frameworks
- Don't add motion just to fill space
- If you're adding an animation just because "it's been a while," don't

### Motion Per Animation

**Approach:** Subtle movement. Motion should underline ideas, not decorate.

**Action items:**
- No bounce expressions
- No overshoot
- No spring physics
- Scale animations: 100% to 102-104% max
- Position animations: 10-20px max movement
- Fade animations: 8-12 frames
- If motion feels noticeable, it's too much

### Motion Style

**Approach:** Smooth-bezier. Elegant, flowing easing curves.

**Action items:**
- Use ease-in-out on all keyframes
- No linear keyframes
- No bounce or overshoot expressions
- Movement should feel inevitable, not energetic

### Pacing Baseline

**Approach:** Breathing room. Intentional silences, not rushed, lets moments land.

**Action items:**
- Let shots breathe
- Hold frames slightly longer than feels natural
- Silence is allowed
- Don't cut just because nothing is happening — cut when something new begins
- Don't add music hits or sound effects to fill silence

## AI Image Generation

### Style Description for Prompts

Use this as a base for any AI image generation:

"Cinematic, sophisticated visual style. Warm muted tones — dusty teals, soft ochres, weathered cream, aged paper browns — with bold red (#CE0000) as the only saturated accent. Deep charcoal (#262626) in shadows. Painterly texture with subtle film grain. A24/Wes Anderson aesthetic — intentional, artistic, confident. Grand but approachable mood. NOT photorealistic, NOT cartoon. Think: elegant diagram in a premium coffee table book, or a frame from an indie film."

### Key Phrases to Include

- "Warm muted tones"
- "Subtle film grain"
- "A24 aesthetic" or "indie film aesthetic"
- "Painterly texture"
- "Sophisticated and intentional"
- "Grand but approachable"
- "NOT photorealistic, NOT cartoon"

### What to Avoid in Prompts

- "Bright" or "vibrant" colors
- "Clean" or "modern" (often leads to corporate)
- "Minimalist" alone (leads to sterile)
- Stock photo descriptions
- Cartoon or illustration styles (unless specifically needed)

## The Visual Litmus Test

Before finalizing any visual:

1. **Does it feel like a luxury brand ad?** If it feels cheap or loud, simplify.
2. **Could this be a frame from an A24 film?** If it feels like a YouTube thumbnail, pull back.
3. **Is every element intentional?** If something is decorative without purpose, remove it.
4. **Does it breathe?** If it feels cluttered or busy, reduce.
