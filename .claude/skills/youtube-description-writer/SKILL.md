# YouTube Description Writer

Create effective YouTube descriptions that convert viewers into subscribers and customers.

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with the primary CTA** — The first line should be your lead magnet or most important offer. This is what viewers see before clicking "Show more."

2. **Proof over promises** — Include specific numbers, dates, and results. "$104,500 from one client" beats "six figures from one client."

3. **Write naturally** — No keyword stuffing. The description should read like a human wrote it, not an SEO tool.

4. **Consistent template** — Use the same structure across all videos. Viewers (and you) benefit from predictability.

5. **150-300 words** — Long enough to provide value, short enough to respect attention.

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ No "alternative video titles for the algo" section (outdated tactic)
- ❌ No hashtags (minimal impact, clutters the description)
- ❌ No keyword repetition (write naturally instead)
- ❌ No generic CTAs ("Like and subscribe!")

## Template A: Artem / Full-Time Editor Style

Use for: Educational content, mentorship/coaching offers, proof-driven videos.

**Characteristics:** Proof-dense, direct, professional. Similar to Ali Abdaal's approach but with more specific results and fewer emojis.

### Structure

```
[Lead Magnet CTA with link]

[Video Summary — 2-3 sentences with specific proof points: exact dollar amounts, timeframes, results. Explain what the video covers and why it matters.]

[Primary Offer CTA — "Want my help..." with tracking link]

Connect with me:
[Social links — X, Instagram, Portfolio]

Chapters:
[Simple timestamps — 0:00 format]

Thanks for watching!
```

### Example (Artem)

```
Get Client DNA Builder here: https://www.skool.com/full-time-editors

I made $104,500 from one editing client over 18 months. In this video, I break down the $700 DM that started it, how I raised my rate to $2,500/video, and the three things high-paying clients actually pay for (it's not what most editors think).

Want my help scaling to $5-10K/month with editing? Apply here: https://www.full-time-editor.com/?utm_source=yt&utm_campaign=104k_from_one_client

Connect with me:
Follow me on X: https://x.com/EditorArtem
Follow me on IG: https://www.instagram.com/editorartem_
My portfolio: https://editorartem.com/portfolio

Chapters:
0:00 - Intro
0:55 - Why most editors are stuck
3:10 - How I landed the $100K client
3:58 - Why editors lose premium clients
6:15 - How to win over high-paying clients
8:26 - How I raised my prices to $2K/video
9:55 - The mistake that almost lost me $100K

Thanks for watching!
```

### Tracking Link Format (Artem)

```
https://www.full-time-editor.com/?utm_source=yt&utm_campaign=[video_topic_slug]
```

- `utm_source` = always "yt"
- `utm_campaign` = video topic in slug format (e.g., "104k_from_one_client")

---

## Template B: Alex / Marketing Examined Style

Use for: Brand storytelling, marketing strategy, trend analysis, videos featuring multiple brands/examples.

**Characteristics:** Elevated, editorial, brand-focused. More links to external resources and brands mentioned. No tracking links.

### Structure

```
[Lead Magnet CTA — free resource related to video topic]

[Primary Offer CTA — service/product offering]

[Video Summary — 2-4 sentences explaining the insight, trend, or framework. More conceptual than proof-dense. Can include a memorable quote or positioning statement.]

## Non-Negotiables (Both Templates)

Every description MUST include:

1. ✅ Lead magnet or primary CTA as first line
2. ✅ Video summary with specific value proposition
3. ✅ "Apply" or "Work with me" CTA
4. ✅ Social links
5. ✅ Timestamps/Chapters
6. ✅ Sign-off or closing element

## Timestamps: How to Get Accurate Timecodes

**IMPORTANT: Never guess timestamps.** Use one of these methods to get accurate timecodes:

### Method 1: YouTube MCP (Preferred)

If the YouTube MCP is configured, use it to fetch captions with timestamps:
- Check `.mcp.json` for `youtube` server
- Use MCP tools to get timestamped transcript data

### Method 2: Transcript Script with --timestamps Flag

Fetch the transcript with timing data preserved:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/youtube-transcript/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "VIDEO_ID" --timestamps
```

This outputs `[M:SS] text` format:
```
[0:00] Today we're talking about social shows
[0:33] Number one understanding your brand's content narrative
[2:14] Developing your content pillars
```

Use these timestamps to identify chapter breaks where topics change.

### Method 3: Ask the User (Fallback)

If neither method is available, ask: "Do you have the timestamps for this video? I can write the chapter titles, but I'll need the actual timecodes from you."

Or use placeholders:
```
Chapters:
00:00 – Opening hook / intro
[TIMESTAMP] – Chapter title here
[TIMESTAMP] – Chapter title here
```

### Identifying Chapter Breaks

When you have timestamped transcript data:
1. Look for topic transitions (new concepts, new sections)
2. Listen for verbal cues ("Number one...", "Next is...", "So here's...")
3. Aim for 8-12 chapters for a 10-15 min video
4. First chapter always starts at 00:00

### Timestamp Format

Use simple timestamps:
- Artem style: `0:00 - Chapter Title`
- Alex style: `00:00 – Chapter Title` (em-dash for Alex's editorial style)

For videos under 1 hour, single-digit minutes are fine (0:00, 3:10, 12:45).
For videos over 1 hour, use full format (0:00:00, 1:14:09).

## Writing Enticing Chapter Titles

Chapter titles should create curiosity and communicate value — not just describe the topic.

### The Problem

❌ **Descriptive (boring):** "Understanding your brand's content narrative"
❌ **Descriptive (boring):** "Repetitive elements and why familiarity is the hook"
❌ **Descriptive (boring):** "Determining your set"

### The Fix

✅ **Benefit-driven:** "The foundation for your social show"
✅ **Intriguing:** "The key to a successful social show"
✅ **Curiosity-inducing:** "What every successful show has in common"

### Chapter Title Principles

1. **Lead with benefit or outcome** — What will the viewer GET from this section?
   - "How I landed the $100K client" > "Finding high-paying clients"
   - "The most important element to a successful show" > "Your opening 3 seconds"

2. **Use intrigue phrases** — These create curiosity:
   - "The key to..."
   - "The foundation for..."
   - "What every [type] has in common"
   - "The #1 reason..."
   - "The mistake that..."
   - "Why most [people] fail at..."

3. **Keep it punchy** — Shorter titles scan better in the YouTube UI
   - 3-8 words is ideal
   - Cut filler words ("Understanding", "An overview of", "Introduction to")

4. **Match the creator's energy:**
   - **Artem:** More direct, proof-based ("How I raised my prices to $2K/video")
   - **Alex:** More conceptual, framework-based ("The backbone of your social show")

### Example Transformation

| Topic | ❌ Descriptive | ✅ Enticing |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Content narrative | Understanding your brand's content narrative | The foundation for your social show |
| Repetitive elements | Repetitive elements and familiarity | The key to a successful social show |
| Set design | Determining your set | What every successful show has in common |
| Opening hook | Your opening 3 seconds | The most important element to a successful show |
| Common mistakes | Why editors lose premium clients | The mistake that almost lost me $100K |

## Extracting Links from Scripts

When the user provides a video script, extract and link all references:

### What to Extract

Scan the script for:
- **Tools & Software** — Apps, platforms, SaaS products mentioned (e.g., "Notion," "Frame.io," "Descript")
- **Brands & Companies** — Any business or brand referenced
- **Books & Courses** — Educational resources mentioned by name
- **People** — Creators, experts, or influencers mentioned (link to their primary platform)
- **Websites & Resources** — Any specific resource or website referenced
- **Products** — Physical or digital products mentioned

### How to Find Links

1. **Use WebSearch** to find the official URL for each reference
2. **Verify with WebFetch** if unsure (check the page loads and is the correct resource)
3. **Prioritize official sources:**
   - Official website > Social media > Third-party mention
   - For people: Their primary platform (YouTube, X, website)
   - For tools: Official product page, not affiliate links

### Adding to Description

**For Artem/Full-Time Editor style:**
Add after the Chapters section:

```
Resources mentioned:
[Tool Name] — [Official URL]
[Book Name] by [Author] — [Amazon/Official link]
[Person Name] — [Their channel/website]
```

**For Alex/Marketing Examined style:**
This already has "Brands mentioned" — expand it to include all resources:

```
Brands & resources mentioned in the video:
[Brand] – [Instagram/website]
[Tool] – [Official URL]
[Book] – [Link]
```

### Example Workflow

1. User provides script
2. Claude extracts: "I use Frame.io for reviews, Notion for organization, and learned this from Ali Abdaal's video on..."
3. Claude searches for each:
   - Frame.io → https://frame.io
   - Notion → https://notion.so
   - Ali Abdaal → https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal
4. Claude adds to description:
   ```
   Resources mentioned:
   Frame.io — https://frame.io
   Notion — https://notion.so
   Ali Abdaal — https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal
   ```

### Quality Standards for Links

- ✅ Use full URLs (not shortened)
- ✅ Link to official sources only
- ✅ Verify links are current (not 404)
- ❌ No affiliate links unless explicitly provided by user
- ❌ No competitor links to user's own products/services
