# YouTube Description Writer

Create effective YouTube descriptions that convert viewers into subscribers and customers.

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with the primary CTA** — The first line should be your lead magnet or most important offer. This is what viewers see before clicking "Show more."

2. **Proof over promises** — Include specific numbers, dates, and results. "$104,500 from one client" beats "six figures from one client."

3. **Write naturally** — No keyword stuffing. The description should read like a human wrote it, not an SEO tool.

4. **Consistent template** — Use the same structure across all videos. Viewers (and you) benefit from predictability.

5. **150-300 words** — Long enough to provide value, short enough to respect attention.

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ No "alternative video titles for the algo" section (outdated tactic)
- ❌ No hashtags (minimal impact, clutters the description)
- ❌ No keyword repetition (write naturally instead)
- ❌ No generic CTAs ("Like and subscribe!")

## Template A: Artem / Full-Time Editor Style

Use for: Educational content, mentorship/coaching offers, proof-driven videos.

**Characteristics:** Proof-dense, direct, professional. Similar to Ali Abdaal's approach but with more specific results and fewer emojis.

### Structure

```
[Lead Magnet CTA with link]

[Video Summary — 2-3 sentences with specific proof points: exact dollar amounts, timeframes, results. Explain what the video covers and why it matters.]

[Primary Offer CTA — "Want my help..." with tracking link]

Connect with me:
[Social links — X, Instagram, Portfolio]

Chapters:
[Simple timestamps — 0:00 format]

Thanks for watching!
```

### Example (Artem)

```
Get Client DNA Builder here: https://www.skool.com/full-time-editors

I made $104,500 from one editing client over 18 months. In this video, I break down the $700 DM that started it, how I raised my rate to $2,500/video, and the three things high-paying clients actually pay for (it's not what most editors think).

Thanks for watching!
```

### Tracking Link Format (Artem)

```
https://www.full-time-editor.com/?utm_source=yt&utm_campaign=[video_topic_slug]
```

- `utm_source` = always "yt"
- `utm_campaign` = video topic in slug format (e.g., "104k_from_one_client")

---

## Template B: Alex / Marketing Examined Style

Use for: Brand storytelling, marketing strategy, trend analysis, videos featuring multiple brands/examples.

**Characteristics:** Elevated, editorial, brand-focused. More links to external resources and brands mentioned. No tracking links.

### Structure

```
[Lead Magnet CTA — free resource related to video topic]

[Primary Offer CTA — service/product offering]

[Video Summary — 2-4 sentences explaining the insight, trend, or framework. More conceptual than proof-dense. Can include a memorable quote or positioning statement.]

Connect with me:
[Social links — IG, X, Podcast]

Brands mentioned in the video:
[List of brands with Instagram/website links — alphabetical or order of appearance]

Chapters:
[Simple timestamps — 00:00 format with em-dash or colon]

```

## Non-Negotiables (Both Templates)

Every description MUST include:

1. ✅ Lead magnet or primary CTA as first line
2. ✅ Video summary with specific value proposition
3. ✅ "Apply" or "Work with me" CTA
4. ✅ Social links
5. ✅ Timestamps/Chapters
6. ✅ Sign-off or closing element

## Timestamp Format

Use simple timestamps:
- Artem style: `0:00 - Chapter Title`
- Alex style: `00:00 – Chapter Title` (em-dash acceptable for Alex's editorial style)

For videos under 1 hour, single-digit minutes are fine (0:00, 3:10, 12:45).
For videos over 1 hour, use full format (0:00:00, 1:14:09).

Before finalizing:

- [ ] First line is the lead magnet/primary CTA
