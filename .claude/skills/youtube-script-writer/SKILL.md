# YouTube Script Writer

Write scripts that turn Artem's Ideal Customer Profile into lifelong fans through story-driven content.

## Knowledge Dependencies

Load these files before writing any script:

**Voice & Stories:**
- `.claude/knowledge/artem/voice-of-artem.md` — Tone, linguistic patterns, signature phrases
- `.claude/knowledge/artem/artem-story-bank.md` — Personal stories to weave into scripts

**Targeting:**
- `.claude/knowledge/full-time-editor/ideal-customer-profile.md` — Demographics, psychographics, motivations
- `.claude/knowledge/full-time-editor/voice-of-customer.md` — Pain points, desires, exact language

**Frameworks:**
- `.claude/knowledge/full-time-editor/framework-definitions.md` — Proprietary systems (Three S's™, Twist & Stick™, etc.)

## Required Inputs

Before starting, confirm you have:
1. **Big Idea** — The core philosophy/belief shift the video creates
2. **Core Concept** — The specific topic or framework being taught
3. **Raw Thoughts** — Artem's voice memo or notes describing his vision
4. **Approved Title** — The packaging (title only; thumbnail handled separately)

If any input is missing, ask for it before proceeding.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Write Hook Variations

Create **3 hook variations** (30-45 seconds each when spoken).

**Hook Structure:**
1. Opening question or pattern interrupt (1-2 sentences)
2. Validation — acknowledge their frustration
3. Contrast — show the gap between where they are and where they could be
4. Concept tease — name the idea that explains the gap
5. Promise — what the video delivers

**Hook Style Hierarchy (in order of preference):**

1. **Observation Question** — Points at something they've noticed but can't explain
   ```
   Why do some editors charge $2K/video while others struggle to hit $2K/month?
   ```

2. **Frustration Validation** — Names the unfairness they feel
   ```
   Why do the editors working the hardest seem to make the least?
   ```

3. **Contrarian Challenge** — Directly challenges conventional wisdom
   ```
   Stop looking for more clients.
   ```

4. **Bold Claim with Proof Tease** — States result, promises breakdown
   ```
   I made over $100K from one client. Here's exactly how.
   ```

**Hook Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Under 45 seconds when read aloud?
- [ ] Opens with question or pattern interrupt?
- [ ] Validates their frustration?
- [ ] Creates contrast (current state vs. desired state)?
- [ ] Plants curiosity points/unclosed loops?
- [ ] Ends with clear promise?

**Output:** Present all 3 hooks and wait for Artem to approve one before proceeding.

### Step 2: Write Full Script

After hook approval, write the complete script.

**Target Length:** 2,000-3,000 words (10-15 minute video at ~200 words/minute)

**Format Requirements:**
- Conversational prose, not bullet points
- No timestamps
- No B-roll or visual notes
- Chapter headings to indicate structure (5-7 chapters typical)
- Write exactly how Artem talks

## Script Structure

### Chapter 1: The Setup/Trap (ends by 3:00 mark)

Establish the problem clearly:
- Name the wrong belief most editors hold
- Show why it keeps them stuck
- Include ONE proof point (student example or personal stat)
- Tease the framework NAME only (don't explain it yet)
- End with a transition question

**If running long, cut:** Extended analogies, multiple examples, full framework explanations.

### Middle Chapters: Progressive Story with Framework Reveal

Each chapter follows this pattern:
1. **Story beat** — A specific moment from Artem's journey
2. **Tension** — What was at stake, what could go wrong
3. **Reveal** — One framework component tied to the story
4. **Application** — How this applies to the viewer

**Critical:** Never dump frameworks all at once. Each component gets its own moment.

### Final Chapter: Resolution + CTA

- Recap the full framework (now that all components have been revealed)
- Reinforce the transformation
- Point to next video or resource

## Core Methodologies

### Progressive Framework Reveal

When introducing proprietary frameworks:

1. **Tease early** — Name it in hook or Chapter 1 without explaining
2. **Reveal progressively** — Each component tied to a story beat
3. **Tie to experience** — Never explain without a specific story showing how Artem learned it
4. **Complete the loop late** — Full recap only in final chapter

**Example (Three S's™ in $104K video):**
- Hook: "Three things high-paying clients actually care about"
- Chapter 3: Reveal "Story" (tied to revisions/cheat code moment)
- Chapter 4: Reveal "Style" (tied to zero revisions breakthrough)
- Chapter 6: Reveal "Schedule" (tied to missed deadline mistake)
- Chapter 7: Recap all three together

### Belief-Breaking Before Teaching

Before teaching any framework, break the beliefs that would prevent acceptance:

1. State what most editors believe (wrong)
2. Explain why it's wrong (with specificity)
3. Introduce what's actually true
4. THEN teach the framework

**Example:**
```
❌ Wrong: "High-paying clients pay for the Three S's: Story, Style, Schedule."

✓ Right: "Most editors think clients pay for more views, better retention, viral videos. Wrong. High-paying clients need someone who makes their life easier. And that comes down to three things..."
```

**Common Beliefs to Break:**
- "More clients = more money" → Leverage > volume
- "Clients pay for views/retention" → Clients pay to make their life easier
- "I need to be faster" → You need to be irreplaceable
- "Flashy effects impress clients" → Story and reliability impress clients

### Story Loop Structure

Every chapter is a story loop with two parts:
1. **Context** — Set up the situation clearly (viewer should be curious, not confused)
2. **Reveal** — Deliver something better than expected or unexpected but intriguing

**The 5 reveal outcomes:**
- Worse than expected → viewer bounces
- Equal to expected → attention fades
- Better than expected → dopamine, keeps watching ✓
- Unexpected but confusing → viewer bounces
- Unexpected but intriguing → dopamine, keeps watching ✓

Aim for "better than expected" or "unexpected but intriguing" reveals.

## Proof Density Requirements

Every major claim needs at least ONE of:
- Exact dollar amount ($104,500 not "six figures")
- Specific date (August 2023 not "a while back")
- Named student with specific results
- Real quote or message

**Never use:**
- "A lot of money" → Use exact number
- "A while ago" → Use month/year
- "One of my students" → Use name + specific result

**If proof is missing:** Flag it and ask Artem:
```
{PROOF NEEDED: What was the exact dollar amount here?}
```

## Personal Story Requirement

Every script MUST wrap concepts in personal stories from `artem-story-bank.md`.

**If no relevant story exists:** Stop and ask Artem:
```
I need a personal story for [concept]. Do you have a specific moment when you learned/experienced this? What happened right before? What almost went wrong?
```

The goal is relatability. Facts inform. Stories transform.

## Writing Voice

Pull patterns from `voice-of-artem.md`. Key characteristics:
- Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones
- Direct address ("You've seen it...")
- Contrarian flips ("Most editors think X. Reality: Y.")
- Specific numbers over vague claims
- Enthusiasm markers in key moments ("That's the signal.")

## Analogy Guidelines

Use analogies to make abstract concepts concrete:
- Relatable to ICP's life (school, gaming, sports)
- Simple enough to understand in one read
- Maps cleanly to the concept
- Memorable and repeatable

**Example (Cheat Code Analogy):**
```
You're in a math exam at school. You haven't prepared at all. But your friend slips you a cheat sheet — not just the answers, but the full solutions.

Most editors copy the final answer and throw away the sheet. They never ask why the client wanted this change.

The editors who level up? They study the solutions. They find the patterns. Eventually, they don't need the cheat sheet anymore.
```

## CTA Integration

One mid-roll CTA per script. Must feel native, not disruptive.

**Pattern:** Teach something valuable → Offer free resource as the "deeper dive"
```
If you want to land high-paying clients, you need to adapt your editing style for each one. So I built this AI tool that follows my exact process... [brief explanation] ...join my free Skool community using the link in the description. Now, back to the story...
