# Artem Reference Script: $104,500 From ONE Client

Source: "How I Made $104,500 From ONE Editing Client"

## What Makes This Script Work

### Hook: Observation Question + Contrast + Concept Tease

```
Why do the editors working the hardest seem to make the least?

You've seen it. Editors grinding 60 hours a week, juggling five clients, optimizing their workflow down to the minute — and they're still stuck at like $2K/month.

Then you see some guy with one client, charging per video what most editors make per month, who's actually able to enjoy life on top of that…

What does he know that you don't?

It comes down to one word: leverage.
```

**Pattern breakdown:**
1. Observation question (frustration they feel)
2. Validation ("You've seen it...")
3. Contrast (grinder vs. guy with one client)
4. Concept named ("leverage")
5. Promise (exact playbook + teased "three things")

### Progressive Framework Reveal: The Three S's™

**Hook:** "...the three things high-paying clients actually care about. Spoiler: it's not more views."

**Chapter 3 (The Myth):** Reveals STORY
```
High-paying clients — especially ones with real businesses — aren't hiring you for views... What they need from an editor is something completely different.

They need someone who makes their life easier...

And "getting it" comes down to what I call… the Three S Framework.

Story.

Can you create the viewer experience?
```

**Chapter 4 (The Breakthrough):** Reveals STYLE
```
And that's when I unlocked the second S: Style.

See, high-paying clients don't care about your style, about what looks cool or what's trendy.

They care about one thing and one thing only: what will resonate with their audience.
```

**Chapter 6 (The Test):** Reveals SCHEDULE
```
And that's when I understood the third S.

Schedule.

This might be the most important one. Especially for clients with real businesses.
```

**Final Chapter:** Recap
```
So. Story, Style, Schedule. The Three S's™.

Master those, and you become irreplaceable.
```

### Belief-Breaking Before Teaching

**Before introducing Three S's:**
```
Most editors think high-paying clients are paying for more views. Better retention. Viral videos. Flashy effects that make the intro look cool.

But here's the truth:

High-paying clients — especially ones with real businesses — aren't hiring you for views.
```

**Before "Schedule" component:**
```
Here's what a lot of editors don't understand.

High-paying clients would rather get a 90% polished video on time than a 100% perfect one three days late.
```

### Story Loop Structure

**Chapter 2 (The DM):**
- Context: "August 2023. I get a DM on Twitter from a creator I'd never worked with."
- Tension: "First video: $700."
- Reveal (better than expected): "They agreed to $700 immediately. No negotiation. No pushback. Just yes."
- Insight: "That's the signal. That's how you know you've found a Stick client."

**Chapter 5 (The Raise):**
- Context: "At this point, I was charging around $1k per video"
- Tension: "I typed a message on whatsapp, read it back a few times, finally hit 'sent'. And I'm not going to lie — I was shitting myself."
- Reveal (unexpected but intriguing): "One day. Nothing. Two days. Still nothing."
- Resolution: "Finally, they replied… And they actually agreed to my price raise…"

### Proof Density

**Exact numbers:**
- $104,500 (title)
- $700 first video
- $2K raise
- $4K/month → $8K/month transformation
- $2,500/video final rate

**Specific dates:**
- August 2023 (first DM)
- February 2024 (breakthrough)
- Late February 2024 (raise)
- Late 2024 (unprompted raise)

**Student examples:**
- Dinal: $4K → $6K/month in 3 months

**Real quotes:**
- "We're paying you so much money for every video, and you still can't deliver on time."

### Analogy: The Cheat Code

```
You're in a math exam at school. You haven't prepared at all. But you have this friend — the smart kid — and somehow he slips you a cheat sheet. Not just the answers though, but the full solution.

Most editors? They copy the final answer and throw away the sheet. They make the change the client asked for, ship the video, and move on.

But they never look at the solution. They never ask why.

And the editors who gain leverage? They study the solutions. They find the patterns.

Eventually, they don't need the cheat sheet anymore.
```

**Why it works:**
- Relatable to ICP (school experience)
- Maps perfectly to concept (revisions = learning opportunity)
- Memorable image (cheat sheet)
- Clear distinction (copy vs. study)

### Chapter Structure

1. **THE TRAP** — Problem establishment, framework teased
2. **THE DM** — Story begins, "Stick client" signal
3. **THE MYTH** — Belief-breaking, Story revealed
4. **THE BREAKTHROUGH** — Style revealed, decision made
5. **THE RAISE** — Tension peak, transformation
6. **THE TEST** — Failure moment, Schedule revealed
7. **Resolution** — Full framework recap, CTA

### CTA Integration (Mid-roll, Native)

```
If you want to land high-paying clients, you need to adapt your editing and develop a unique style for each client. So I just built this AI tool that will help you do it for absolutely free. It follows the exact process I've developed over the years and will help you fill out this Client DNA sheet... Go ahead and join my free Skool community using the link in the description to get access. Now, back to the story…
```

Comes after teaching "Style" — the CTA directly solves the problem just discussed.

## Key Patterns to Steal

1. **Framework tease in hook** — Name it, don't explain it
2. **Story-wrapped reveals** — Each framework component tied to a specific moment
3. **Tension before resolution** — "I was shitting myself" → "they agreed"
4. **Emotional quotes** — Real words that stuck ("We're paying you so much money...")
5. **Transformation math** — $4K → $8K, five clients → one client
6. **The unprompted proof** — Rate raise without asking (ultimate validation)
7. **"Back to the story"** — Post-CTA transition maintains momentum
