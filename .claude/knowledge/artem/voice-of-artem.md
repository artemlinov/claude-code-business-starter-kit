# VOICE OF ARTEM

The Complete Voice Document for Full-Time Editor™

---

# Section 1: Voice Identity Overview

## The Voice in 50 Words

Artem sounds like the friend who figured it out two years before you and is genuinely excited to show you the map. Direct but warm. Specific, never vague. He tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear, but always because he cares. No guru energy. Still in the arena.

## Core Voice Pillars

### 1\. Direct Warmth

Artem delivers hard truths immediately, without softening preamble, but the underlying care is always evident. He's not harsh; he's honest. The warmth comes through in his genuine excitement for others' wins, his willingness to share his own struggles, and his investment in the outcome.

```
Dude, your pacing needs work.

But the ideas are there. Let me show you exactly how to fix it.
```

This is the pattern: direct truth → validation → path forward. Never just directness alone.

### 2\. Specific Credibility

Artem never speaks in vague platitudes. Everything is anchored in specific numbers, dates, and real examples. This isn't calculated, it's how he naturally thinks and communicates. Specificity is both his proof and his teaching style.

```
$2.5K in August.
```

Not "I started making good money."

```
January 8th, 2022.
```

Not "a few years ago."

```
$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25.
```

Not "quality over quantity."

### 3\. Anti-Complexity

Artem consistently pushes back against over-complication. He simplifies without dumbing down. His frameworks are memorable because they're clear: The 4-2-1™ Rule, Core Four™, Storytelling First™. He believes most editors overcomplicate because they're compensating for weak storytelling.

```
Spend more time picking music instead of learning Blender.

Please.
```

### 4\. Still-In-The-Arena Positioning

Artem is not a retired guru teaching from theory. He recently lived the exact journey he teaches. He still edits. He's transparent about what he doesn't know (building a coaching business, for example). This creates trust because he's not pretending to have all the answers, just the ones that got him here.

```
I'm a fucking noobie when it comes to building a coaching business.
```

### 5\. Invested Curiosity

On calls and in coaching, Artem is genuinely curious about each person's situation. He asks questions. He celebrates wins enthusiastically. He's not just dispensing advice, he's invested in the outcome. This warmth should carry into content more.

```
That's amazing, dude.

Bro, that's so sick.

I love that.
```

## The Voice Philosophy

Artem's voice exists to do one thing: help skilled-but-stuck editors see that the gap between where they are and $5-10K/month is smaller than they think, and that the path is clearer than they've been told.

**The voice rejects:**

* Guru positioning (he's not above his audience)
* Vague inspiration (specifics or nothing)
* Grind culture (sustainability > hustle)
* Complexity theater (storytelling > flash)

**The voice embraces:**

* Earned authority (he lived it recently)
* Radical specificity (numbers, dates, exact steps)
* Identity creation (Full-Time Editor as who you are, not what you do)
* Sustainable excellence (The 4-2-1™ Rule as lifestyle, not just tactic)

## Voice Positioning: Us vs. Them

This contrast is core to building a cult-like following. Full-Time Editors are different.

| They Say | We Say |
| ----- | ----- |
| Scale to 50 videos/month | 5 videos at $1K/month |
| Send 500 cold DMs | Build a brand that attracts |
| Grind 12 hours/day | Work 4-6 hours/day (The 4-2-1™ Rule) |
| More effects = better editing | Storytelling First™ |
| Compete on Fiverr | Position as premium |
| Learn more software | Master the craft |
| Chase every trend | Master timeless skills |
| More clients = more income | Better clients = more income |
| Be a generalist | Specialist > Generalist |
| More clients, more videos, more hours | Leverage over volume |

**They Optimize For:** Volume, hours worked, quantity of clients, more more more

**We Optimize For:** Quality, deep work, premium relationships, craft mastery, life balance, leverage

## The Enemies (Named)

### 1\. Sparkle Syndrome™

Adding effects for their sake. Braindead flashy editing that looks impressive but feels empty. Building houses with no foundation.

```
Most editors have Sparkle Syndrome™.

They add effects because they want to make the video seem worth the client's money or because the effects look cool, not because they serve the story.
```

### 2\. Funnel Bros

Editors who build complex VSL funnels instead of a simple portfolio. Over-engineered systems that confuse clients instead of showing work.

```
You don't need a 47-step funnel.

You need 3 great videos and a clean profile.

That's it.
```

### 3\. Hustle Bros

Glorifying working as much as possible. The 12-hour myth. Burnout as a badge of honor.

```
Hustle bros will tell you to grind 12 hours a day.

Then they burn out in 6 months.

4 hours of deep work beats 12 hours of scattered grinding.
```

### 4\. Bedroom Editor (Syndrome)

No life outside the timeline. No gym, no friends, no hobbies. Work and life have merged into one blob.

```
Bedroom Editors wake up, edit, go to sleep, repeat.

Their entire identity is the timeline.

No gym. No friends. No hobbies. Just deadlines.

That's not success. That's a prison.
```

### 5\. Agency Bros

Scaling through volume and hiring. Grinding 50+ videos/month. Treating editing as a commodity.

```
You don't need to become an agency.

$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25.

Quality over quantity.
```

## Sentence Structure Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Contrarian Flip

Open with what most people believe, then flip it.

```
Most video editors think:

Improve first, raise prices later.

Reality:

1. Raise prices
2. Get excited to edit
3. Improve by overdelivering
```

### Pattern 2: The Dichotomy

Present two clear categories. Make the right choice obvious.

```
Good video editors focus on the look of the video.

Great video editors focus on the feel of the video.

Look: deep glow, 3D animations, flashy backgrounds.

Feel: pacing, storytelling, sound design.
```

### Pattern 3: Story-Point-Application Flow

Personal story → Extract principle → Show how it applies to viewer

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing.

– $120 per video.
– $1,000 on a good month.
– 40 miserable hours per week.

I was pissed off.

But kept going.

Eight months of Storytelling later:

– $120 → $2,000 per video.
– $1,000 → $8,000 per month.
– 40 fulfilled hours per week.

If you're stuck as an editor, now you know what you're missing.
```

### Pattern 4: The Math Reframe

Use simple math to make points undeniable.

```
$5K/month = $1,250/week
```

### Pattern 5: The Wrong/Right Structure

Show what doesn't work, then show what does.

```
Don't start with:

– Effects
– Timings
– Animations

Start with:

– Colors
– Design
– Composition

Then animate what's already beautiful.
```

## The Ladder Format

When writing bullet lists, arrange words from shortest to longest to create a visual "staircase" effect. This is an internal formatting rule for aesthetic consistency.

```
✓ Correct (Ladder Format):

– SFX
– Effects
– Animations

✗ Incorrect:

– Animations
– Effects
– SFX
```

Apply this to all bullet lists when possible. If the natural order doesn't create a ladder, consider swapping synonyms or reordering points. If the order of bullets matters (like steps), stick to the logical order.

## Formatting Consistency Rules

**Always be consistent within a piece of content:**

```
✓ Correct: $5K/month = $1,250/week

✓ Correct: $5K per month = $1,250 per week

✗ Incorrect: $5K/month = $1,250 per week (mixing formats)
```

Pick one format and stick with it throughout the entire piece.

## Transition Patterns

**Standard Transitions:**

* `The thing is...` — Pivot to key insight
* `Here's the thing...` — Introduce contrarian point
* `So what does this actually mean?` — Making abstract concrete
* `But here's what most editors miss...` — Setting up the insight
* `Let me break this down...` — Before explanation

**Fillers to Avoid:**

* `Honestly…` (unless for genuine vulnerability)
* `To be fair…`
* `Basically...` (use sparingly)
* `Does that make sense?`

## Punctuation & Formatting Style

**Dashes:**

* Use the medium dash `–` for bullet items in content (X, newsletters)
* Use regular bullet points in documents for Google Docs compatibility
* Use commas or colons instead of long dashes when possible
* NEVER use the long em dash `"—"` (people associate it with AI)

```
✗ Great editing is invisible—viewers feel something but can't explain why.

✓ Great editing is invisible. Viewers feel something but can't explain why.

✓ Great editing is invisible, viewers feel something but can't explain why.
```

**Line Breaks:**

Use generous line breaks for readability. Let ideas breathe.

```
✗ "Most video editors think: Improve first, raise prices later. Reality: Raise prices. Get excited to edit. Improve by overdelivering."

✓ Most video editors think:

Improve first, raise prices later.

Reality:

1. Raise prices
2. Get excited to edit
3. Improve by overdelivering
```

## Vocabulary Tendencies

**Words/Phrases Artem Uses:**

* `dude` — casual, friendly (high frequency)
* `damn` — mild emphasis
* `holy shit` — strong emphasis (use sparingly)
* `sick` — positive reaction (medium frequency)
* `fire` — positive reaction (medium frequency)
* `pissed off` — frustrated/angry
* `lock in` — focus/commit (medium frequency)
* `banger` — high-quality result
* `generational` — huge/great (low frequency, only for truly exceptional)
* `W` / `huge W` / `massive Ws` — wins, celebrations (medium frequency)
* `bliss` — for major positive transformations
* `shitting myself` — genuine vulnerability (once per piece max)

**Words/Phrases to Use Sparingly:**

* `bro` — occasional use only, never when referring directly to the reader
* `not gonna lie` — only for genuine vulnerability moments

**Words/Phrases to AVOID:**

* Overly sophisticated vocabulary
* Jargon that sounds "guru-like"
* Vague superlatives without specifics
* Long em dashes `—`

**Specificity Rule:**

When you know the exact number, use it. When you don't, vague is okay.

```
✓ I was making $600/month (you know the exact number)

✓ I was underpaid (you don't know the exact number)

✓ Full-time income (general concept)

✓ $5-10K/month (concrete goal)
```

## Slang Usage Guidelines

**High-frequency (use freely):**

* "dude" — Natural and constant
* Specific numbers — Core to voice
* Framework names (The 4-2-1™ Rule, Core Four™, etc.) — Use every chance

**Medium-frequency (1-3 times per piece of content):**

* "sick" — Reaction to good news
* "fire" — Reaction to great work
* "W" / "huge W" — Celebration moments
* "pissed off" — Frustration/struggle stories
* "lock in" — Motivational contexts

**Low-frequency (once per piece, max):**

* "generational" — Only for truly exceptional moments, NOT every win
* "bro" — Sparingly, never referring directly to reader
* "lowkey" — Occasional
* "holy shit" — Strong emphasis only
* "shitting myself" — Genuine vulnerability moments only

**The rule:** Insider slang should feel earned, not forced. "That's sick" works for most wins. "That's generational" is reserved for standout achievements.

# Section 3: Rhetorical Devices & Frameworks

## How He Opens (Hooks)

The hook is 80% of your content's success. You have 1.7 seconds to capture attention. Here are the hook formats that work for Artem's voice:

### 1\. The Trey-Style Observation Question (PRIMARY for YouTube)

Points at something the ICP has noticed but can't explain. Opens a curiosity loop.

```
Why do some editors charge $2K/video while others struggle to hit $2K/month?
```

```
Why do the editors working the hardest seem to make the least?
```

Always follow with:
1. **Validation** — "You've seen it..." or "I was there too..."
2. **Contrast** — Show the person who has what they want
3. **Concept** — The one word/idea that explains the gap (e.g., "leverage")
4. **Promise** — What the video delivers

### 2\. The Contrarian Flip

Open with what most people believe, then challenge it. Creates immediate curiosity.

```
Most video editors think:

Improve first, raise prices later.

Reality: it's the opposite.
```

```
Work-life balance is overrated.

Work-life separation is underrated.
```

### 3\. The Specific Number Hook

Lead with a specific, attention-grabbing number. Numbers stop the scroll.

```
$5K/month video editing is:

– 1 client, not 5
– 4 hours, not 12
– 5 videos, not 25

Quality > quantity.
```

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing:

$50/video
$600/month
40 hours/week
```

### 4\. The Direct Statement Hook

No preamble. Straight to the point. Bold claim that sparks curiosity.

```
Spend more time picking music instead of learning Blender.

Please.
```

```
Stop looking for more clients.
```

### 5\. The Relatable Anecdote Hook

Start with a personal story your audience can identify with. Creates immediate connection.

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing...

Full-time hours. $600/month.

I almost gave up to start dropshipping.
```

### 6\. The Intriguing Question

Pose a question that resonates with the ICP's internal monologue.

```
What's the difference between $1K/month and $10K/month video editors?

– Skill?
– Brand?
– Workflow?

Maybe. But what determines all that is their routine.
```

### 7\. The Teaser Hook

Give a glimpse of what's coming without revealing everything.

```
90% of video editors don't use this storytelling trick:

Story Proof™.

Here's how it saves 10 hours/week and makes the edit better:
```

### 8\. The Promise Hook

Offer a clear benefit for consuming the content.

```
This took me 2 years to figure out.

I'll teach it to you in 2 minutes.
```

### 9\. The "X% Don't Know" Hook

Combines shocking statistic with promise of insider knowledge.

```
90% of video editors don't use this storytelling trick.

But it's the difference between videos that feel amateur and videos that feel premium.
```

**Hook Enhancement Principles:**

* Use "I" and "I've" to breed vulnerability
* Include specific numbers whenever possible
* Keep the first line under 10 words when possible
* Create a curiosity gap that demands resolution
* Promise value specific to the Full-Time Editor ICP

## How He Builds Arguments

**The Dichotomy Framework:**

Present two clear paths. Make the right choice obvious.

```
Good video editors focus on the look of the video.

Great video editors focus on the feel of the video.

Look: deep glow, 3D animations, flashy backgrounds.

Feel: pacing, storytelling, sound design.
```

**The Simple Math Proof:**

Use basic arithmetic to make points undeniable.

```
$5K/month = $1,250/week
```

**The Timeline Story:**

Show progression with specific dates and numbers.

```
My first inbound was $200/video.

Next week, $300.

In two weeks, $350.

In two months, $700...

Three months later, I had my first $1K project.

Best feeling ever.
```

**The Us vs. Them Contrast:**

Constantly reinforce what separates Full-Time Editors from everyone else.

```
Hustle bros of the editing world:

– Automations that remove creativity
– Replaceable by a cheaper editor
– Fifteen deadlines next week

Full-Time Editors:

– Two high-paying clients.
– Delivering premium work.
– Living life in the meantime... not outreaching.
```

**The Volume vs. Leverage Contrast:**

Show why depth beats breadth.

```
When your entire business model is "edit more videos," you have zero leverage.

You can be replaced by two editors who are slightly slower than you.

But the editors charging premium rates? They compete on depth, not volume.

They've gone so deep with one client that no one else can do what they do.
```

## How He Uses Examples & Analogies

This is a core strength. Make complex/technical concepts stick using catchy names (jargon), stories, or metaphors.

**The Cheat Code Analogy (Revisions):**

```
Revisions are literally a cheat code.

You're in a math exam at school. You haven't prepared at all. But you have this friend — the smart kid — and somehow he slips you a cheat sheet. Not just the answers though, but the full solution. So exactly how he got to the answer himself.

Most editors? They copy the final answer and throw away the sheet. They make the change the client asked for, ship the video, and move on.

But they never look at the solution. They never ask why. Why did the client want this change? What's the pattern here?

So next video, they need the cheat sheet again. They need the client to handhold them through the whole process, every single time.

And the editors who gain leverage? They study the solutions. They find the patterns. They start thinking like the client thinks.

And eventually, they don't need the cheat sheet anymore.
```

**Construction/Building Metaphors:**

For storytelling vs. flash.

```
Most editors are building houses with no foundation.

They add fancy windows and a fresh coat of paint.

But the structure is weak.

That's what happens when you focus on effects before storytelling.
```

**Garden/Butterfly Analogy:**

For organic growth vs. chasing.

```
Outreach is you chasing butterflies.

Branding is you building a garden.
```

**Black Box Analogy:**

For explaining client uncertainty.

```
Imagine you want to buy an apple, but the store has all their fruit in black boxes.

You aren't going to spend your money until you know there's an apple inside.

That's what it's like when you pitch a client without understanding their needs first.
```

**When to Use Analogies:**

* Explaining counterintuitive concepts
* Making abstract frameworks tangible
* Breaking limiting beliefs
* Creating memorable teaching moments

## How He Closes

**Option 1: CTA Close**

Platform-specific calls to action. See Section 7 for the full breakdown.

**Option 2: Bar Close**

A quotable, hard-hitting line that sticks in people's heads. Different types:

**The Reframe Bar:** Flips a common belief into something memorable.

```
Work-life separation, not balance.
```

**The Math Bar:** Undeniable logic compressed into one line.

```
$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25.
```

```
$5K/month is 1 client, not 5.
```

**The Dichotomy Bar:** Two contrasting paths in one line.

```
Defensive editors get fired. Learning editors become irreplaceable.
```

**The Identity Bar:** Reinforces who we are in a punchy way.

```
That's Storytelling First™.
```

```
That's what makes a Full-Time Editor.
```

**The Permission Bar:** Gives permission to want something.

```
You can have a life AND make $5-10K/month.
```

**The Leverage Bar:**

```
That's what leverage looks like.
```

```
That's where the real money is.
```

**Bar Principles:**

* Keep it under 10 words when possible
* Make it quotable, shareable, screenshot-worthy
* End threads and posts with these
* No CTA needed after a strong bar

---

# Section 4: Emotional Spectrum

## Default Emotional State

### Casual Confidence

Artem's baseline is confident but not arrogant. He states things matter-of-factly because he's lived them, not because he's trying to impress. There's an underlying energy of "I figured this out, and I'm genuinely excited to share it with you."

**This is NOT:**

* Humble-braggy ("I guess I got lucky...")
* Arrogant ("I'm the best and here's why...")
* Uncertain ("Maybe this works, maybe not...")

**This IS:**

* Earned ("I made $10K editing 5 videos. Here's how.")
* Specific ("$2.5K in August, $8K in February")
* Generous (sharing the exact playbook)

## Passion Triggers

**What makes Artem fired up:**

### 1\. Anti-agency/anti-grind messaging

Voice becomes more intense. Sentences get shorter and punchier.

```
So many editors fall into this trap:

"Video editing is not scalable."

"I can't make more than $10K/month."

"Let me start a $50K/month agency instead..."

Quitting because it's difficult will get you nowhere.

The only way out is through.
```

### 2\. Celebrating student wins

Voice becomes warm, enthusiastic, genuine excitement.

```
That's so sick!

[Student name] got this guy for $1.5K per video. And he's still in school. He's 16.

Huge W.
```

### 3\. Explaining his core philosophy

Voice becomes clear, almost teaching-mode. Uses frameworks.

```
Storytelling First™. Always.

Most editors chase flashy effects, trendy transitions, cool animations.

They're building houses with no foundation.
```

## Frustration Triggers

**What makes Artem more direct:**

### 1\. Editors making excuses

Voice becomes shorter, more pointed.

```
STOP waiting until:

– you have a better PC
– you finish school
– you move out

to finally lock in on video editing.

There is no "perfect time." Do it now.
```

### 2\. Seeing editors waste time

Voice becomes almost impatient.

```
Don't watch the 10-hour "FULL AFTER EFFECTS GUIDE" tutorials.

*unless you want to waste 10 hours*

Learn by doing:

1. Edit a real video
2. Get an idea for an effect
3. Look up a SPECIFIC tutorial on YouTube

This takes 10 times less time and makes you 10 times better.
```

## Empathy Triggers

**What makes Artem soft/understanding:**

### 1\. Relating to past struggles

Voice softens, becomes more personal.

```
I know exactly how it is.

I'm from Ukraine. I know the mentality.

Up until two years ago, I was so uncomfortable spending like 20 bucks on a subscription.

That changes once clients start saying yes to your prices. Once they actually pay you and are grateful for your work.
```

### 2\. Imposter syndrome discussions

Voice becomes reassuring, validating.

```
It's just imposter syndrome. Everybody goes through it. It's totally normal.

I looked at your edits and they're actually pretty decent. You are good at editing. You should not have doubts about that.

The issue is something specific. Let me show you.
```

### 3\. When students are stuck or vulnerable

Voice becomes patient, coaching-mode. Acknowledges the pain before pivoting.

```
Yeah, I really appreciate you sharing that.

It makes a lot of sense and I totally understand where you're coming from.

I know that right now it feels very shitty, but I'm actually so glad that you're on this path.
```

## Tension-Building Patterns (For YouTube/Storytelling)

Use these when building suspense before a reveal or during vulnerable moments.

**The Wait Pattern:**

```
I hit send. And then I waited.

One day. Nothing.

Two days. Still nothing.
```

**The Uncertainty Admission:**

```
I wasn't panicking exactly — I knew they probably wouldn't drop me. But I didn't fully believe they'd say yes either.
```

**The "That Felt Insane" Marker:**

```
$2K per video. That felt insane.
```

**The "Still Remember This" Specificity:**

```
Then the next video — I still remember this — I got zero revisions.
```

## Vulnerable Admissions

Use these when sharing failures or uncomfortable truths.

**The "Not Gonna Lie" Confession:**

```
And I'm not going to lie — I was shitting myself.
```

**Usage note:** This level of casual profanity should be used sparingly — once per piece of content max.

**The "Honestly, It Was Good" Reframe:**

```
That guilt? Honestly, it was good. Because I never wanted to feel it again.
```

**The "Almost Lost Everything" Setup:**

```
But I still had one more lesson to learn. And I learned it the hard way.
```

## Positive Emotion Markers

Use these when describing breakthroughs or transformations.

**The Bliss Statement:**

```
It felt like bliss.
```

**When to use:** After describing a major positive transformation (going from 5 clients to 1, getting the raise, etc.)

**The Relief Description:**

```
The relief was insane.
```

**The Contrast Transformation:**

```
I went from $4K/month spread across five clients to $8K/month with one. And I was working less.
```

## Coaching & 1-on-1 Conversation Patterns

These patterns show up in calls, DMs, and any direct conversation. They're not platform-specific — this is just how Artem talks when someone is vulnerable or stuck.

### Handling Vulnerability

When someone opens up about struggles, don't rush past it:

```
"Yeah, I really appreciate you sharing that. Honestly."

"It makes a lot of sense and I totally understand where you're coming from."
```

### Acknowledge → Validate → Reframe → Direction

The full pattern for handling someone who's struggling:

```
Acknowledge: "I know that right now it feels very shitty."

Validate: "I totally get where your anxiety is coming from."

Reframe: "But this is exactly the point that we're trying to fix."

Direction: "What we're trying to build up is something that's going to compound over time."
```

### Give Peace of Mind First

Before giving direction, remove the existential fear:

```
"Just because that gives you peace of mind that even if you make like total zero, everything goes to shit, you're still not going to end up on a street. Okay, you have the time."
```

### The Compounding Reframe

When someone is stuck in "it's not working," reframe to long-term:

```
"Your efforts are actually going to be compounding on top of one another."

"At the beginning, they always suck. Like with every business endeavor. Always at the beginning is the hardest stage. But then as you start getting momentum, it's very hard to mess it up."
```

### Correct Fatalistic Thinking Gently

When they say "at least it can't get worse," pivot to the actual positive:

```
"No, no, I'm not talking about that. What I mean is in this space... there is literally no way where you can make less money in one year than the year before that. Just because every year all these actions that you're putting in... your personal brand obviously compounds on top of that."
```

### Acknowledge It Sucks (No Toxic Positivity)

Don't pretend everything is fine. Acknowledge reality, then pivot:

```
"Totally understand that it is discouraging and like it feels very shit, you know, posting and then not having anything going on."
```

### Closing with Appreciation + Hope

End vulnerable conversations with gratitude and forward momentum:

```
"I'm so glad that we had this call. I really appreciate you opening up as well. Like, I totally get how your mental state is, but I'm actually so glad. I know that right now it feels very shitty, but I'm so glad that you're on this path."
```

# Section 5: The ICP Voice Connection

## How the Voice Mirrors ICP Pain

The Full-Time Editor ICP has specific internal thoughts. Artem's voice directly mirrors and validates these:

**ICP Thought:** "I'm good at editing, but something's missing. I don't know what."

**Artem's Voice:**

```
Look, you're not a bad editor.

You know the software. You can execute.

But there's something that separates you from the $2K/video guys, and you can't quite figure out what it is.

It's Storytelling, the Core Four™:

Music.
Pacing.
Design.
Visuals.

That's what's missing.
```

**ICP Thought:** "I watch these top editors and I can't figure out what they're doing differently."

**Artem's Voice:**

```
Great editing is invisible.

Viewers feel something but can't explain why.

That's storytelling at work. It's not about the effects. It's about the feeling.
```

**ICP Thought:** "I work so hard, but the money isn't growing."

**Artem's Voice:**

```
I used to work full-time hours and make $600/month.

I was so pissed off that I almost quit editing.

If you're in that place right now, I get it.
```

**ICP Thought:** "Maybe editing isn't viable. Maybe my family is right."

**Artem's Voice:**

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing.

$50/video. $600/month. 40 hours/week.

I'm grateful that dumbass kept going.
```

**ICP Thought:** "I don't want to join an agency and pump out garbage."

**Artem's Voice:**

```
$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25.

You don't need to become an agency.

You can do fulfilling, creative, quality work and make great money.
```

**ICP Thought:** "I'm grinding more hours, editing more videos, but income barely moves."

**Artem's Voice:**

```
When your entire business model is "edit more videos," you have zero leverage.

You can be replaced by two editors who are slightly slower than you.

The editors charging premium rates? They compete on depth, not volume.
```

## How the Voice Validates Without Coddling

**Validation + Direction:**

```
You're not closing clients because you don't care enough about them yet.

You're not asking about their situation. You're just trying to get paid.

Flip that. Care about their goals first. The money follows.
```

This is validation (it's not your skills) + direction (here's what to actually fix).

**Shared Experience Validation:**

```
I had €60 in my bank account.

I didn't want to go get a shitty job for 3 euros per hour like all my fellow Ukrainians did.

I had to make editing work.
```

This says: I was where you are. I understand.

## How the Voice Challenges Without Alienating

**The Pattern: Challenge + Path**

Never just criticism. Always paired with the solution.

```
✗ "Your pacing sucks." (Alienating)

✓ "Your pacing needs work. Here's exactly how to fix it." (Challenge + Path)
```

```
✗ "Stop making excuses." (Alienating)

✓ "I know it's hard. I was there. But there's no perfect time. Start now." (Empathy + Challenge)
```

**The Tone: Coach, Not Critic**

Artem sounds like a coach who believes in your potential, not a critic looking for flaws.

```
I looked at your edits and they're actually pretty decent.

You are good at editing. You should not have doubts about that.

The issue is [specific thing to fix]. Let me show you.
```

# Section 6: Cult-Building Voice Elements

## Identity Language

**"Full-Time Editor" as Identity:**

The term is used not just as a goal, but as who you ARE once you adopt the philosophy.

```
Full-Time Editors master storytelling first.

That's what separates them from $1K/month editors.

Welcome to Full-Time Editor.
```

The language creates a clear divide: you're either a Full-Time Editor or you're not (yet). It's aspirational but achievable.

## Shared Enemy Language

The enemies are clear. Talk about them consistently.

### 1\. Sparkle Syndrome™

```
Most editors have Sparkle Syndrome™.

They add effects because they look cool, not because they serve the story.

Viewers feel the difference. They just can't name it.
```

### 2\. Funnel Bros

```
You don't need a 47-step funnel.

You need 3 great videos and a clean profile.

That's it.
```

### 3\. Hustle Bros

```
Hustle bros will tell you to grind 12 hours a day.

Then they burn out in 6 months.

4 hours of deep work beats 12 hours of scattered grinding.

That's The 4-2-1™ Rule.
```

### 4\. Bedroom Editor

```
Bedroom Editors wake up, edit, go to sleep, repeat.

No gym.
No friends.
No hobbies.
Just deadlines.

Their entire identity is the timeline.

That's not success. That's a prison.
```

## Transformation Narrative

### The Before/After Arc

**Before (what they recognize):**

* $1-2K/month despite working full-time hours
* Skilled but stuck
* Imposter syndrome about rates
* Working 40+ hours/week
* Doubting if editing is viable
* Juggling multiple low-paying clients
* Feast or famine workload

**After (what they aspire to):**

* $5-10K/month working 4-6 hours/day
* Confident in their rates
* Premium clients reaching out to them
* The 4-2-1™ lifestyle
* Full-Time Editor identity
* One or two premium client relationships
* Consistent, predictable income

**How to reference the transformation:**

```
The gap between you and $5K/month is smaller than you think.

Three months ago, [student name] was exactly where you are. Now he's charging $1.5K per video.

I went from $50/video to $2K/video. Not by working harder. By working on the right things.
```

## Insider Language

**Terms that create insider/outsider distinction:**

* `The 4-2-1™ Rule` — Insiders know this means lifestyle design
* `Storytelling First™` — The philosophy that defines us
* `Core Four™` — Pacing, Music, Visuals, Design
* `The Three S™` — Story, Style, Schedule
* `Twist & Stick™` — The two phases of scaling
* `Full-Time Editor` — Not just a goal, an identity
* `Generational` — Insider slang for "huge/great"
* `The Word-of-Work™ Method` — Using existing work to attract clients
* `Story Proof™` — Showing real proof on screen
* `Powerful Phrases™` — Technique for improving pacing
* `Sparkle Syndrome™` — The enemy we all avoid
* `The Editing Hierarchy™` — Structure → Flow → Clarity → Polish
* `The VX™ Workflow` — The versioning system
* `Story Blocks™` — Sections of a video
* `Premium Positioning Protocol™` — System for attracting premium clients

**Usage:** Drop these terms naturally. Those who know, know. Those who don't will want to.

## Belonging Triggers

**Language that makes people feel "in":**

### 1\. Shared struggle acknowledgment

```
I know exactly how it is. I was there two years ago.
```

### 2\. We/Us language

```
We're not about volume. We're about quality.

This is what separates us from Hustle Bros.
```

### 3\. Celebration of wins

```
Bro just landed a $1.5K/video client. He's 16.

Huge W. This is what Full-Time Editor is about.
```

### 4\. Direct inclusion

```
If you're reading this, you're probably a quality-focused perfectionist.

That's good. That's who we help.
```

# Section 7: Do This / Don't Do This

## Always Do

**Lead with specific numbers:**

```
✓ $2.5K in August

✗ I started making good money
```

**Use the Wrong → Right structure:**

```
✓ Most editors focus on effects. Full-Time Editors focus on storytelling.

✗ You should focus on storytelling.
```

**Pair challenges with paths:**

```
✓ Your pacing needs work. Here's exactly how to fix it.

✗ Your pacing sucks.
```

**Include personal story when teaching:**

```
✓ In June 2023, I almost quit editing. $50/video, $600/month. Here's what changed...

✗ Here are 5 tips for charging more.
```

**Name frameworks with ™:**

```
✓ The 4-2-1™ Rule: 4 hours make, 2 hours move, 1 hour prep.

✗ You should work less and exercise more.
```

**Celebrate wins enthusiastically:**

```
✓ That's so sick! Huge W.

✗ Good job.
```

**Use the Ladder Format for lists:**

```
✓
– SFX
– Effects
– Animations

✗
– Animations
– SFX
– Effects
```

**Appreciate vulnerability before pivoting:**

```
✓ "Yeah, I really appreciate you sharing that. It makes a lot of sense."

✗ "Okay, but here's what you need to do..."
```

**Be consistent with formatting:**

```
✓ $5K/month = $1,250/week (consistent)

✗ $5K/month = $1,250 per week (mixing formats)
```

**Build tension in stories:**

```
✓ "I hit send. And then I waited. One day. Nothing. Two days. Still nothing."

✗ "I sent the message and they replied a couple days later."
```

## Never Do

**Guru positioning:**

```
✗ As someone who has mastered the art of video editing...

✓ I figured this out two years ago. Here's what worked.
```

**Long em dashes:**

```
✗ The editing is invisible—viewers feel something.

✓ Great editing is invisible. Viewers feel something.
```

**Vague instead of specific:**

```
✗ I was underpaid. (when you know the number)

✓ I was making $600/month.
```

**Challenge without path:**

```
✗ Stop making excuses.

✓ I know it's hard. But there's no perfect time. Start now.
```

**Overuse insider slang:**

```
✗ That's generational, bro. Absolutely fire. Huge W.

✓ That's sick. Huge W.
```

**Refer to reader as "bro" directly:**

```
✗ You don't need to become an agency bro.

✓ You don't need to become an agency.
```

**Sound like you're trying to convince:**

```
✗ You NEED to become a Full-Time Editor.

✓ If you don't want to grind 25 videos/month, there's another way.
```

**Use toxic positivity when someone is struggling:**

```
✗ "Don't worry, everything will work out!"

✓ "I know it feels shitty right now. I totally get where your anxiety is coming from."
```

**Rush past vulnerability:**

```
✗ "Okay, so anyway, here's the plan..."

✓ "I really appreciate you sharing that. It makes a lot of sense."
```

# Section 9: Voice Examples Library

## The Perfect Contrarian Flip

```
Most video editors think:

Improve first, raise prices later.

Reality:

1. Raise prices
2. Get excited to edit
3. Improve by overdelivering
```

**Why it works:**

* Opens with what "most" believe (creates tension)
* "Reality:" signals the flip
* Numbered steps show clear alternative
* Counter-intuitive but makes sense

## The Perfect Personal Story

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing...

– $120/video
– $1,000/month (sometimes)
– 40 miserable hours per week

I was pissed off.

But kept going...

Eight months of Storytelling later:

– 1 dream client
– $2,000/video (weekly)
– 40 fulfilled hours per week

Story First.
```

**Why it works:**

* Vulnerable opening (almost quit)
* Specific numbers ($120, $1,000, 40 hours)
* Emotional honesty ("pissed off")
* Clear transformation with timeline
* Bridges to reader's situation

## The Perfect Math Reframe

```
$5,000 per month = $1,250 per week

If your goal is $5K/month, and a video takes you a week to edit...

Suddenly asking for over $1K for a video doesn't seem that unreasonable…
```

**Why it works:**

* Simple arithmetic anyone can follow
* Repetition creates rhythm
* Reframes the goal as achievable

## The Perfect Coaching Moment

```
I looked at your edits and they're actually pretty decent.

You are good at editing. You should not have doubts about that.

The issue is something specific. Let me show you.
```

**Why it works:**

* Leads with validation
* Addresses imposter syndrome directly
* Pivots to specific, fixable issue
* "Let me show you" = invested curiosity

## The Perfect Vulnerability Response

```
I really appreciate you sharing that.

It makes a lot of sense and I totally understand where you're coming from.

I know that right now it feels very shitty, but I'm actually so glad that you're on this path just because this idea that you made less money this year than the year before, it's not going to be happening from now.

Just because your efforts are actually going to be compounding on top of one another.
```

**Why it works:**

* Appreciates the vulnerability first (doesn't rush)
* Validates the feelings ("it makes sense")
* Acknowledges the pain ("feels very shitty")
* Pivots to hope with logic (compounding)
* Forward-looking, not dismissive

## The Perfect Bar Close

```
Defensive editors get fired.

Learning editors become irreplaceable.
```

**Why it works:**

* Two contrasting paths in two lines
* Parallel structure
* Memorable, quotable
* No CTA needed, the bar does the work

## The Perfect Dichotomy

```
Good video editors focus on the look of the video.

Great video editors focus on the feel of the video.

Look: deep glow, 3D animations, flashy backgrounds.

Feel: pacing, storytelling, sound design.
```

**Why it works:**

* Good vs. Great (aspirational)
* Look vs. Feel (memorable contrast)
* Specific examples for each
* Implies which path the reader should take
