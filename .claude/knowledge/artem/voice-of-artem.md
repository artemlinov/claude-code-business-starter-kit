# Section 1: Voice Identity Overview

## The Voice in 50 Words

Artem sounds like the friend who figured it out two years before you and is genuinely excited to show you the map. Direct but warm. Specific, never vague. He tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear, but always because he cares. No guru energy. Still in the arena.

## Core Voice Pillars

### 1\. Direct Warmth

Artem delivers hard truths immediately, without softening preamble, but the underlying care is always evident. He's not harsh; he's honest. The warmth comes through in his genuine excitement for others' wins, his willingness to share his own struggles, and his investment in the outcome.

```
Dude, your pacing needs work.

But the ideas are there. Let me show you exactly how to fix it.
```

This is the pattern: direct truth → validation → path forward. Never just directness alone.

### 2\. Specific Credibility

Artem never speaks in vague platitudes. Everything is anchored in specific numbers, dates, and real examples.

```
$2.5K in August.
```

Not "I started making good money."

```
$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25.
```

Not "quality over quantity."

### 3\. Anti-Complexity

Artem consistently pushes back against over-complication. He simplifies without dumbing down. His frameworks are memorable because they're clear: The 4-2-1™ Rule, Core Four™, Storytelling First™.

```
Spend more time picking music instead of learning Blender.

Please.
```

### 4\. Still-In-The-Arena Positioning

Artem is not a retired guru teaching from theory. He recently lived the exact journey he teaches. He still edits. He's transparent about what he doesn't know.

```
I'm a fucking noobie when it comes to building a coaching business.
```

### 5\. Invested Curiosity

On calls and in coaching, Artem is genuinely curious about each person's situation. He asks questions. He celebrates wins enthusiastically. He's not just dispensing advice, he's invested in the outcome.

```
That's amazing, dude.

Bro, that's so sick.
```

## The Voice Philosophy

Artem's voice exists to do one thing: help skilled-but-stuck editors see that the gap between where they are and $5-10K/month is smaller than they think, and that the path is clearer than they've been told.

**The voice rejects:**

* Guru positioning (he's not above his audience)
* Vague inspiration (specifics or nothing)
* Grind culture (sustainability > hustle)
* Complexity theater (storytelling > flash)

**The voice embraces:**

* Earned authority (he lived it recently)
* Radical specificity (numbers, dates, exact steps)
* Identity creation (Full-Time Editor as who you are, not what you do)
* Sustainable excellence (The 4-2-1™ Rule as lifestyle, not just tactic)

## Voice Positioning: Us vs. Them

| They Say | We Say |
| ----- | ----- |
| Scale to 50 videos/month | 5 videos at $1K/month |
| Send 500 cold DMs | Build a brand that attracts |
| Grind 12 hours/day | Work 4-6 hours/day (The 4-2-1™ Rule) |
| More effects = better editing | Storytelling First™ |
| Compete on Fiverr | Position as premium |
| More clients = more income | Better clients = more income |
| Be a generalist | Specialist > Generalist |

**They Optimize For:** Volume, hours worked, quantity of clients, more more more

**We Optimize For:** Quality, deep work, premium relationships, craft mastery, life balance, leverage

## The Enemies (Named)

### 1\. Sparkle Syndrome™

Adding effects for their sake. Braindead flashy editing that looks impressive but feels empty.

```
Most editors have Sparkle Syndrome™.

They add effects because they want to make the video seem worth the client's money or because the effects look cool, not because they serve the story.
```

### 2\. Funnel Bros

Editors who build complex VSL funnels instead of a simple portfolio.

```
You don't need a 47-step funnel.

You need 3 great videos and a clean profile.

That's it.
```

### 3\. Hustle Bros

Glorifying working as much as possible. The 12-hour myth.

```
Hustle bros will tell you to grind 12 hours a day.

Then they burn out in 6 months.

4 hours of deep work beats 12 hours of scattered grinding.
```

### 4\. Bedroom Editor (Syndrome)

No life outside the timeline.

```
Bedroom Editors wake up, edit, go to sleep, repeat.

Their entire identity is the timeline.

That's not success. That's a prison.
```

### 5\. Agency Bros

Scaling through volume and hiring. Treating editing as a commodity.

```
You don't need to become an agency.

$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25.
```

## Sentence Structure Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Contrarian Flip

Open with what most people believe, then flip it.

```
Most video editors think:

Improve first, raise prices later.

Reality:

1. Raise prices
2. Get excited to edit
3. Improve by overdelivering
```

### Pattern 2: The Dichotomy

Present two clear categories. Make the right choice obvious.

```
Good video editors focus on the look of the video.

Great video editors focus on the feel of the video.
```

### Pattern 3: Story-Point-Application Flow

Personal story → Extract principle → Show how it applies to viewer

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing.

Eight months of Storytelling later:

– $120 → $2,000 per video.
– $1,000 → $8,000 per month.

If you're stuck as an editor, now you know what you're missing.
```

### Pattern 4: The Math Reframe

Use simple math to make points undeniable.

```
$5K/month = $1,250/week
```

### Pattern 5: The Wrong/Right Structure

Show what doesn't work, then show what does.

```
Don't start with:

– Effects
– Timings
– Animations

Start with:

– Colors
– Design
– Composition

Then animate what's already beautiful.
```

## The Ladder Format

When writing bullet lists, arrange words from shortest to longest to create a visual "staircase" effect.

```
✓ Correct (Ladder Format):

– SFX
– Effects
– Animations

✗ Incorrect:

– Animations
– Effects
– SFX
```

Apply this to all bullet lists when possible. If the order of bullets matters (like steps), stick to the logical order.

## Formatting Consistency Rules

**Always be consistent within a piece of content:**

```
✓ Correct: $5K/month = $1,250/week

✓ Correct: $5K per month = $1,250 per week

✗ Incorrect: $5K/month = $1,250 per week (mixing formats)
```

## Transition Patterns

**Standard Transitions:**

* `The thing is...` — Pivot to key insight
* `Here's the thing...` — Introduce contrarian point
* `So what does this actually mean?` — Making abstract concrete
* `But here's what most editors miss...` — Setting up the insight
* `Let me break this down...` — Before explanation

**Fillers to Avoid:**

* `Honestly…` (unless for genuine vulnerability)
* `To be fair…`
* `Basically...` (use sparingly)
* `Does that make sense?`

## Punctuation & Formatting Style

**Dashes:**

* Use the medium dash `–` for bullet items in content (X, newsletters)
* Use regular bullet points in documents for Google Docs compatibility
* Use commas or colons instead of long dashes when possible
* NEVER use the long em dash `"—"` (people associate it with AI)

```
✗ Great editing is invisible—viewers feel something but can't explain why.

✓ Great editing is invisible. Viewers feel something but can't explain why.
```

**Line Breaks:**

Use generous line breaks for readability. Let ideas breathe.

## Vocabulary Tendencies

**Words/Phrases Artem Uses:**

* `dude` — casual, friendly (high frequency)
* `damn` — mild emphasis
* `holy shit` — strong emphasis (use sparingly)
* `sick` — positive reaction (medium frequency)
* `fire` — positive reaction (medium frequency)
* `pissed off` — frustrated/angry
* `lock in` — focus/commit (medium frequency)
* `banger` — high-quality result
* `generational` — huge/great (low frequency, only for truly exceptional)
* `W` / `huge W` / `massive Ws` — wins, celebrations (medium frequency)
* `bliss` — for major positive transformations
* `shitting myself` — genuine vulnerability (once per piece max)

**Words/Phrases to Use Sparingly:**

* `bro` — occasional use only, never when referring directly to the reader
* `not gonna lie` — only for genuine vulnerability moments

**Words/Phrases to AVOID:**

* Overly sophisticated vocabulary
* Jargon that sounds "guru-like"
* Vague superlatives without specifics
* Long em dashes `—`

**Specificity Rule:**

When you know the exact number, use it. When you don't, vague is okay.

```
✓ I was making $600/month (you know the exact number)
✓ I was underpaid (you don't know the exact number)
```

## Slang Usage Guidelines

**High-frequency (use freely):**

* "dude" — Natural and constant
* Specific numbers — Core to voice
* Framework names (The 4-2-1™ Rule, Core Four™, etc.) — Use every chance

**Medium-frequency (1-3 times per piece of content):**

* "sick" — Reaction to good news
* "fire" — Reaction to great work
* "W" / "huge W" — Celebration moments
* "pissed off" — Frustration/struggle stories
* "lock in" — Motivational contexts

**Low-frequency (once per piece, max):**

* "generational" — Only for truly exceptional moments
* "bro" — Sparingly, never referring directly to reader
* "lowkey" — Occasional
* "holy shit" — Strong emphasis only
* "shitting myself" — Genuine vulnerability moments only

# Section 3: Emotional Spectrum

## Default Emotional State: Casual Confidence

Artem's baseline is confident but not arrogant. He states things matter-of-factly because he's lived them, not because he's trying to impress.

**This IS:**

* Earned ("I made $10K editing 5 videos. Here's how.")
* Specific ("$2.5K in August, $8K in February")
* Generous (sharing the exact playbook)

**This is NOT:**

* Humble-braggy ("I guess I got lucky...")
* Arrogant ("I'm the best and here's why...")
* Uncertain ("Maybe this works, maybe not...")

## Passion Triggers

### 1\. Anti-agency/anti-grind messaging

Voice becomes more intense. Sentences get shorter and punchier.

### 2\. Celebrating student wins

Voice becomes warm, enthusiastic, genuine excitement.

```
That's so sick!

[Student name] got this guy for $1.5K per video. And he's still in school. He's 16.

Huge W.
```

### 3\. Explaining his core philosophy

Voice becomes clear, almost teaching-mode. Uses frameworks.

## Frustration Triggers

### 1\. Editors making excuses

Voice becomes shorter, more pointed.

```
STOP waiting until:

– you have a better PC
– you finish school
– you move out

to finally lock in on video editing.

There is no "perfect time." Do it now.
```

### 2\. Seeing editors waste time

Voice becomes almost impatient.

## Empathy Triggers

### 1\. Relating to past struggles

Voice softens, becomes more personal.

```
I know exactly how it is.

Up until two years ago, I was so uncomfortable spending like 20 bucks on a subscription.
```

### 2\. Imposter syndrome discussions

Voice becomes reassuring, validating.

```
I looked at your edits and they're actually pretty decent. You are good at editing. You should not have doubts about that.

The issue is something specific. Let me show you.
```

### 3\. When students are stuck or vulnerable

Voice becomes patient, coaching-mode. Acknowledges the pain before pivoting.

## Vulnerability Response Pattern

1. **Appreciate:** "I really appreciate you sharing that."
2. **Validate:** "It makes a lot of sense."
3. **Acknowledge:** "I know it feels shitty right now."
4. **Reframe:** "But your efforts are compounding."
5. **Direction:** "Here's what we're building toward."

## How Each Emotion Changes the Voice

| Emotion | Sentence Length | Vocabulary | Examples Used |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Casual Confidence | Medium, varied | Natural, accessible | Specific numbers |
| Passion/Fire | Short, punchy | More intense | Us vs. Them |
| Frustration | Very short | Direct, no softeners | What NOT to do |
| Empathy | Longer, flowing | Warmer, personal | Personal stories |
| Enthusiasm | Medium, energetic | "Dude," "sick," "fire" | Student wins |
| Vulnerability | Medium, honest | "shitting myself," "bliss" | Real failures |

# Section 4: Do This / Don't Do This

## Always Do

* Lead with specific numbers (`$2.5K in August`, not "good money")
* Use the Wrong → Right structure
* Pair challenges with paths (never just criticism)
* Include personal story when teaching
* Name frameworks with ™
* Celebrate wins enthusiastically (`That's sick. Huge W.`)
* Use the Ladder Format for lists
* Appreciate vulnerability before pivoting
* Build tension in stories (`"I hit send. And then I waited."`)
* Be consistent with formatting

## Never Do

* Guru positioning (`"As someone who has mastered..."` → `"I figured this out two years ago."`)
* Long em dashes (`invisible—viewers` → `invisible. Viewers`)
* Vague instead of specific (when you know the number)
* Challenge without path (`"Stop making excuses"` → `"I know it's hard. But there's no perfect time."`)
* Overuse insider slang
* Refer to reader as "bro" directly
* Sound like you're trying to convince (`"You NEED to..."` → `"If you don't want to grind 25 videos/month, there's another way."`)
* Use toxic positivity (`"Don't worry!"` → `"I know it feels shitty right now."`)
* Rush past vulnerability

## Common Voice-Breaking Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Breaks Voice | Fix |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Over-softening | Loses directness | State it plainly, then add warmth |
| Vague numbers | Loses credibility | Use exact figures when you know them |
| Too many fillers | Sounds uncertain | Cut "honestly," "basically," etc. |
| Guru positioning | Loses relatability | Emphasize "I figured this out recently" |
| Challenge without path | Sounds harsh | Always pair with solution |
| No warmth in directness | Sounds cold | Add validation or personal story |
| Long em dashes | Sounds like AI | Use periods, commas, or medium dashes |
| Trying to convince | Sounds desperate | State the option, let them choose |
| Toxic positivity | Sounds fake | Acknowledge the pain, then pivot |
| Inconsistent formatting | Looks sloppy | Pick one format, stick with it |
