# Current Context

*Updated: Friday, January 30, 2026*

## Active Projects

**Micro Offer Launch (Feb 14)** ⭐ TOP PRIORITY
- Product: $499 30-Day Sprint, 10 spots
- Email sequence: In progress, finishing Saturday Jan 31
  - Two tracks: (1) people who haven't had sales calls, (2) people who have
  - Claude Code infrastructure built for email writing
- Gamma checkout page: Saturday Jan 31
- Skool post/announcement: Saturday Jan 31
- First email goes out: Feb 1
- Onboarding section + Zapier integrations: Feb 8-13
- Goal: $40K launch (20 spots × $499 + 50% upsell conversion to main program)
- Funnel consideration: May switch to monthly cohort model (open few days/month, waitlist otherwise) - decide after launch with Oli

**Artem Editing Pack Launch** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
- Contents: Presets, sound effects, AE templates (Stripe dashboard etc.), logo library
- Keep it minimal - "things I actually use daily"
- Name: "Artem Editing Pack" (personal brand > generic)
- Video: Creating myself (30-sec talking head + motion graphics)
  - Considered outsourcing to Bottant or Antonello from community, decided DIY showcases skills better
  - Project file becomes bonus content
- Timeline: Sunday-Monday production, Tuesday Feb 4 release
- Purpose: Drive Skool signups before micro offer launch
- Potential: 300-1000 new Skool members
- Will be evergreen pinned post on Twitter (7K followers, currently underutilized)

**Kirill Vlog**
- Status: V2 received, needs restructuring
- Next: Artem doing rough cut TODAY (Friday), hand to Kirill to finalize
- Note: Kirill moving next week, limited availability
- Challenge: Kirill executes well but lacks creative director vision - Artem needs to set structure first
- Vlog heavily plugs free Skool community, so getting it out drives micro offer leads

**FTE Production - Alex Garcia**
- Status: Video 2 published Wednesday Jan 29
- Next: Waiting on Alex for next recording (requested 2 videos at once)
- Deal: $4K upfront + $4K/month retainer
  - Invoice acknowledged but not yet paid (Alex is busy, Artem trusts it'll come)
  - Don't follow up on invoice yet - give it until next week
- SOP: Complete (needs polish with discoveries from latest edit)
- Editor handoff: Tiago crushed trial intro, Luca's trial less impressive (seems lazy)
  - Both ready to take next videos once Alex records
- Strategy: Don't expand scope (offering pre-production help) until current arrangement is flowing smoothly
- Pre-production system needed eventually: Script reviewer/restructurer for Alex's brain dump recordings

**Starter Story Thumbnails**
- Status: In progress, latest thumbnail completed Thursday night
- Rate: $250/thumb + SOP documentation
- Timeline: 8-10 thumbnails, project done by mid-February
- Recording Looms while creating for SOP development
- SOP creator system: Will feed Loom transcripts to Claude Code to generate SOP doc (don't build system before having transcripts)

**VA - Eliza**
- Status: Hired (as of this week), starting with curriculum tasks
- Performance: Looking good so far
- Post-launch plan: Add Skool lead management
  - Accepting members into community
  - Flagging qualified leads in GoHighLevel
  - Template DM conversations promoting micro offer (like Oli does in RemotePro)
- Don't stack new responsibilities until validating basics

**FTE Content**
- $104K video: Published
- Client DNA lead magnet: Done
- Newsletters: Back burner until after micro offer launch (3 solid ideas banked)
- YouTube: New video idea captured (will use outlier video finder system later, not priority now)

**Taylor Interview**
- Status: Tier 4 (after launch)
- Purpose: Student success testimonial content

## Post-Launch Plans

- **Blueprint call with Oli (RemotePro):** Rethink funnel strategy with actual launch data
  - Consider: monthly cohort model vs always-open
  - Consider: micro offer as main gateway, upsell to full program
  - Consider: simplifying/eliminating current landing page + TypeForm application
- **Program revamp:** Rebuild around "creative director" positioning
- **Newsletter restart:** Resume consistent sending
- **VA expansion:** More Skool admin delegation to Eliza

## Big Picture - 2026

**Jan 15 - Feb 15 projection:** ~$20K generated (Alex retainer + micro offer launch)

**Building phase:** Currently in "omega lock in" mode - momentum is high, systems are compounding, don't break the rhythm

**Mid-March:** Potential family holiday
- Concern: might break momentum
- Reframe: If running monthly cohort model, can schedule around it (push to April 1st launch)
- Decision: Don't skip it - one week won't kill systems that are running

**June onwards:** 
- Birthday
- FTE community meetup (content opportunity)
- Asia travel with friends (Bali, Japan)
- This is the "let loose" phase after building hard Jan-May

## Personal Life

**Dating - Brazilian Girl:**
- Didn't cut things off immediately
- Sent voice memo about curiosity concern (she wasn't curious about his interests)
- She responded well, now more engaged
- Both know it's not long-term (she's graduating, might move cities)
- Current stance: Let it run naturally - connection without pressure, good practice
- Not actively pursuing other dating during building phase

**Fitness:** 
- 2700 cal training days, 2300 rest days
- 10K steps consistent (evening walks)
- Gym around 1-2pm daily
- Pre-workout: 200mg caffeine (latest caffeine by 2pm)
- Feeling good physically

**Sleep:** 
- Generally good, 7-8 hours
- Occasional 4am wake-ups but falling back asleep
- Magnesium supplementation helping
- Challenge: New exciting ideas disrupt sleep sometimes (building phase side effect)
- Bedtime: Usually 11-11:30pm

**Personal admin:** Cleared this week
- ✅ Revolut fixed
- ✅ Curtains picked up and hung
- ✅ Visa agency call completed (awaiting email with info)
- ✅ Clothes ordered

**Pending personal tasks:**
- Apple Store (AirPods Max repair)
- Wi-Fi company office (update payment method) - has some time pressure
- Friend owes €500 (follow up now that Revolut is sorted)

## Key Insights This Week

**Creative Director Positioning:** 
- Breakthrough realization from sales call with Sunni
- What Artem teaches is how to become a creative director, not just an editor
- Creative directors think from viewer's perspective, ask "does this need to be included," restructure for engagement
- This explains income gap: per-video editors vs monthly retainer creative directors
- Will rebuild entire FTE program around this positioning after launch
- The Kirill vlog situation is a perfect example: he can execute, but needs Artem to set creative direction first

**Claude Code Infrastructure:** 
- Major unlock this week
- Building systems while working instead of as separate overhead tasks
- Operational: YouTube scriptwriter, email sequences, description writer
- Knowledge files were too big initially - had to condense for context limits
- This is "exactly what I've been looking for" - all knowledge in one place, easily tweakable

**Processing Walks:**
- Evening walks with Claude are creating clarity and reducing mental load
- Externalizing projects immediately calms the mind
- Pattern: brain dump → organize → action plan → execute with focus
- These walks are a core part of the system now

## Coaching Programs Context

**Founder OS (Matt Grey):**
- Runs through late March 2026
- Weekly inner circle calls started (met Kevin, software engineer, talked about AI/Claude Code)
- Main value: networking
- Won't renew - too advanced for current stage

**Remote Pro (Oli Carlson):**
- 12-month program, enrolled November 2025
- Blueprint to $20k/month
- More aligned than Founder OS
- Blueprint call planned after micro offer launch to optimize funnel

## Systems & Tools

**Active:**
- Claude Code: Core workflow tool now
- GoHighLevel: CRM, email sequences, lead tagging
- Gamma: Checkout pages (has Claude Code API)
- Skool: Free community (driving leads)
- Twitter: 7K followers, about to become active funnel piece with editing pack

**Tagging strategy (keep simple):**
- For micro offer launch: 3 tags only
  1. Clients (exclude from launch emails)
  2. Past sales calls (shorter sequence)
  3. Everyone else (full sequence)
- Don't pre-build complex tag systems - let them emerge from actual workflow

## Patterns to Watch

- **Scope creep on exciting ideas:** Editing pack went from "basically ready" to VSL + motion graphics + bonus content in one conversation. Caught it, but watch for this.
- **System building as procrastination:** Can feel productive while avoiding the actual task. "Build the system" vs "do the thing."
- **Sleep disruption from ideas:** New ideas causing overnight mental churn. Capture in voice memo, then let go.
- **Type 1 perfectionism:** Expecting systems to fix everything. Good enough and done > perfect and never finished.
