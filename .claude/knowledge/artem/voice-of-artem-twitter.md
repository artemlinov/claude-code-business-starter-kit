## The X/Twitter Voice in 30 Words

Punchy, compressed, contrarian hooks. Line breaks for rhythm. Quotable endings. Every tweet should feel like a screenshot-worthy insight compressed into the fewest words possible.

---

## What Works on X

* Short, punchy sentences
* Contrarian flips
* Specific numbers
* Line breaks for readability
* The Ladder Format for lists
* Bar closes
* Medium dashes `–` for bullet items

---

## The Viral Tweet Format (Gold Standard)

This is Artem's most viral tweet structure. Use it as the template for educational content:

```
Video editors, pay attention.

First, you make it flow:

– Music
– Pacing
– Fine cut

Then, you make it clear:

– Story
– Graphics
– Digestibility

Lastly, you make it pop:

– SFX
– Effects
– Animations

In that order.
```

**Why it works:**

* Direct hook ("Video editors, pay attention")
* Clear hierarchy (flow → clear → pop)
* Ladder Format on all lists
* Contrarian (most editors start with "pop")
* Bar close ("In that order.")
* Highly shareable, quotable
