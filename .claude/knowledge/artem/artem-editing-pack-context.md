# Artem Editing Pack - Launch Video Context

## Purpose
Create a 30-second launch video for Twitter to drive signups to the free Full-Time Editor Skool community. This will be a pinned post / evergreen asset.

## What's in the Pack
Keep it minimal - only things Artem actually uses daily:
- **Presets** (Premiere Pro & After Effects)
- **Sound effects** library
- **After Effects templates** (e.g., Stripe dashboard made with shape layers)
- **Logo library** (high-res logos of companies, built up over years)

## Video Style
- Mix of talking head footage + motion graphics/animations
- Personal, not generic SaaS-explainer style
- Premium and minimalistic feel
- Artem creating this himself (showcases his skills, project file can become bonus content)

## Script Requirements
- ~30 seconds total
- Hook: Announce the pack is being released for free
- Brief credibility line (one of the options below)
- Quick walkthrough of what's included
- CTA: Get it free in the Skool community

## Credibility Angle Options (pick one, keep it simple)
1. **Experience angle:** "I've been editing for 5 years" / "worked with X clients"
2. **Hours angle:** "Thousands of hours of editing" (don't overclaim 10K if not accurate)
3. **Money angle:** "Generated $250K from editing" or "First $1K project in 2023, hundreds since"
4. **Keep it humble:** Skip the grandiose claims entirely, just "here's what I use daily"

Artem's instinct: Don't make it too grandiose. Simple and authentic > impressive claims.

## Tone
- Confident but not braggy
- Personal and direct
- "This is what I actually use" energy
- Minimalist = premium

## Context for CTA
- Pack is FREE
- Available inside the Full-Time Editor Skool community (also free to join)
- Goal: Drive 300-1000 new Skool members before Feb 14 micro offer launch

## Artem's Background (for credibility reference)
- 5 years editing experience
- Worked with creators and businesses
- Runs Full-Time Editor coaching program
- Based in Lisbon
- Known for clean, professional editing style

## Examples to Reference
Artem watched launch video examples for inspiration - the pattern is: quick hook, show what's included, clear CTA. Don't overcomplicate.

## Naming Decision
Stick with "Artem Editing Pack" - personal brand > generic "Full-Time Editor Pack"
