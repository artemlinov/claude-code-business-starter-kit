# Section 1: Origin Stories

## The Beginning: Fortnite Montages

* Downloaded DaVinci Resolve to edit Fortnite montages
* Started connecting with other Fortnite editors online
* Realized you can make money doing this thing
* **January 8th, 2022:** First gig on Fiverr ($5)
* **April 22nd, 2022:** Won Fortnite editing contest ($15) — first "big" win

## The €60 Moment (June 2022)

Living in a dorm for refugees. Rent was €80. Had €60 in bank account. Didn't want to get a €3/hour job like other Ukrainians — no skills learned, no growth potential.

In half a day, spun up Upwork profile. First client was a faceless cash cow channel — $25 for a 12-minute video. Delivered, got hit with tons of revisions, couldn't meet unreasonable expectations for $25. Filed dispute, lost.

**Lessons learned:**

* Low-paying clients suck
* Faceless videos suck

Landed a $100 motion design project (1-day deadline). Delivered. Paid rent.

## The Two-Year Grind (2022-2023)

* Made around $700 in August 2022
* Around $800 in October
* Got a $40/hour client and was scared
* Income fluctuating constantly
* Discovered Hamza, started self-improvement arc
* Thought it'd be cool to edit videos like Hamza's instead of Upwork motion design

## The Transition (March 2023)

* Made $0 in March 2023
* Worked with a self-improvement creator for free (cold email outreach)
* April 2023: First paying client — $50/video
* After first video, raised to $80/video because of overdelivery

## Almost Quit (June 2023)

Working full-time hours. Making $500-600/month. Had been trying for TWO YEARS.

Saw 16-year-olds on social media making hundreds of thousands dropshipping.

**What kept him going:** If he quit, he'd have wasted 2 years.

**Quote for content:**

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing.

– $120/video
– $1,000/month (sometimes)
– 40 miserable hours per week

I was pissed off.

But kept going.
```

# Section 2: Breakthrough Moments

## Twitter Launch (June 2023)

* Set a challenge: post on Twitter daily for 30 days
* Started landing clients
* $2.5K in August 2023
* Started treating himself better (clothes, food, apartment, stopped pirating software)

## The $700 DM (August 2023)

Got a DM on Twitter from a creator. First video: $700. They agreed immediately — no negotiation, no pushback.

**The signal:** Their budget wasn't the constraint. His skill was. They would have paid more if he was better.

This was the shift from Twist to Stick.

## Zero Revisions (January/February 2024)

After months of studying revisions and finding patterns, submitted a V1 that was basically perfect. Zero revisions.

**The realization:** Had gone so deep into the client's format that he was thinking like them.

## The $2K Ask (Late February 2024)

Was charging around $1K/video. Wanted to go exclusive with weekly videos. The number that made sense: $2K/video.

**The message sent:**

```
So this is corny as hell because I've literally asked for a raise like a week ago...

But I am so hyped for the trajectory we are on, I want to go absolutely crazy on each vid and obviously with less and less help from you...

You asked me to charge whatever I'm comfortable with but honestly I'm uncomfortable as fuck with charging this much but the good thing is that it's gonna push me to put my best out there for each video...

So can we raise it to $2K per video?

Let me know if not though it's completely understandable and no hard feelings whatsoever.
```

**The wait:** One day. Nothing. Two days. Still nothing.

**The response:**

```
$2K per video ✓

Just send the invoice same way through that typeform

Great job on last video bro – let's keep crushing it this year
```

**The transformation:**

* Dropped other clients
* Went from $4K/month across 5 clients to $8K/month with 1 client
* Working less, more fulfilled
* "It felt like bliss"

## The $2.5K Raise (Late 2024)

Working on a slightly different format. More complex. Client raised rate to $2,500/video.

**He didn't even ask.** That's what happens when you keep improving quality without being asked.

## $10K Month (December 2024)

Hit $10K in one month from editing only. Achieved everything he wanted with editing. Started Full-Time Editor.

# Section 3: Failure Stories

## The $25 Upwork Disaster (June 2022)

First Upwork client. Faceless cash cow channel. $25 for 12-minute video. Tons of revisions. Unreasonable expectations. Filed dispute, lost.

**Lesson:** Low-paying clients have unrealistic expectations. Faceless content sucks.

## The Missed Deadline (June 2024)

Charging $2K/video. Been working together almost a year. Missed a deadline by 3 days.

Was so focused on making the video perfect that he lost track of time.

**The message that stung:**

```
"We're paying you so much money for every video, and you still can't deliver on time."
```

**The lesson:** High-paying clients would rather get 90% polished on time than 100% perfect three days late. Schedule is the most important S for clients with real businesses.

**Never missed a deadline again.**

## The Complacency Period (April-May 2024)

Got comfortable at ~$7K/month. Stopped posting on Twitter for 3-4 months. Stopped building brand.

**Lesson:** Even with a stable client, keep building long-term assets. Brand protects you if anything changes.

# Section 4: Transformation Stories

## Thailand Trip (September 2024)

Travelled to Thailand. Met interesting people. Gained new perspectives.

**Realizations:**

* Had been playing it safe with the $2K/video client
* Needed to think bigger
* Travel opens up new perspectives

This trip sparked the idea for Full-Time Editor.

## Dropping Out of Uni

After Thailand, dropped out of university to go all-in on editing and FTE.

## The 2025 "Fuck You" to Bedroom Editors

Spent entire 2025 travelling:

* Stayed with editor friends
* Moved to Bali with Oskar (first coaching student, now best friend)
* Villa with Oskar and Guilherme
* Trained for kickboxing fight (professional coach, $60/session)
* **Flew mom and sister to Bali to watch the fight**
* Lost the fight but amazing experience
* Paid for 3-week family holiday afterwards

**Invested $25K in mentorships in 2025**

Living proof that the Full-Time Editor lifestyle is real.

# Section 6: Key Quotes & Messages

## From Clients

**The missed deadline sting:**

```
"We're paying you so much money for every video, and you still can't deliver on time."
```

**The $2K approval:**

```
"$2K per video ✓. Just send the invoice same way through that typeform. Great job on last video bro – let's keep crushing it this year."
```

## From Artem

**The almost-quit moment:**

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing.

– $120/video
– $1,000/month (sometimes)
– 40 miserable hours per week

I was pissed off. But kept going.
```

**On the bliss of one client:**

```
"No more juggling five different deadlines. No more 60-hour weeks after a month of no work. No more context-switching between completely different formats. Just one client. One format. One relationship to nurture. It felt like bliss."
```

**On asking for the $2K raise:**

```
"I hit send. And then I waited. One day. Nothing. Two days. Still nothing. I wasn't panicking exactly — I knew they probably wouldn't drop me. But I didn't fully believe they'd say yes either. $2K per video. That felt insane."
```

# Section 7: Lessons & Principles (From Experience)

## The Cheat Code (Revisions)

```
Revisions are literally a cheat code.

You're in a math exam. You haven't prepared. But your friend slips you a cheat sheet — not just the answers, but the full solutions.

Most editors copy the final answer and throw away the sheet. They never ask why.

The editors who level up? They study the solutions. They find the patterns. Eventually, they don't need the cheat sheet anymore.
```

## 90% On Time > 100% Late

```
High-paying clients would rather get a 90% polished video on time than a 100% perfect one three days late.

Overdelivering is a luxury. Their posting schedule is not.
```

## Volume vs. Leverage

```
When your entire business model is "edit more videos," you have zero leverage. You can be replaced by two editors who are slightly slower than you.

The editors charging premium rates compete on depth, not volume. They've gone so deep with one client that no one else can do what they do.
```

## The Signal for Stick

```
If a client agrees easily to your price — no negotiation, no pushback — that tells you something important: their budget isn't the constraint. Your skill is.

That's the signal. That's how you know you've found a Stick client.
```

## The Red Animation Lesson (Jan 2026)

Editing a video for Alex. Tried an animation — didn't work. Tried multiple colors. None worked. Ended up going super simple: one color, red.

**The reframe:**

```
Every failed attempt is context.

It's not just "deliver and get paid." You're building your context window.

The more context you collect with a client, the more valuable you become. The more you can charge.

This is why working with one client beats juggling five.
```
