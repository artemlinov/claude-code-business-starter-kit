# ARTEM'S JOURNEY

5-Year Reflection Document for Full-Time Editor™

---

# Section 1: The Timeline

## Phase 1: Discovery (2021-2022)

### How It Started

* Downloaded DaVinci Resolve to edit Fortnite montages
* Living in parents' house, about to have exams / go to uni
* Started connecting with other Fortnite editors online
* Realized you can make money doing this thing

### First Wins

* **January 8th, 2022:** First gig on Fiverr ($5)
* **April 22nd, 2022:** Won Fortnite editing contest ($15) — first "big" win

---

## Phase 2: Survival Mode (June 2022 - February 2023)

### The €60 Moment (June 2022)

Forced to move out at 18. Living in a dorm for refugees. €60 in bank account, €80 rent due.

Didn't want to get a €3/hour job like other Ukrainians — no skills learned, no growth potential.

In half a day: spun up Upwork profile, started applying to everything.

### The $25 Disaster

First Upwork client: faceless cash cow channel. $25 for a 12-minute video. Tons of revisions, unreasonable expectations. Filed dispute, lost.

**Lessons:**

* Low-paying clients suck
* Faceless videos suck

### The $100 Save

Landed a $100 motion design project with 1-day deadline. Delivered. Paid rent.

### The Grind

* Made ~$700 in August 2022
* ~$800 in October 2022
* Got a $40/hour client and was scared
* Income fluctuating constantly
* Discovered Hamza, started self-improvement arc

---

## Phase 3: The Transition (March 2023 - June 2023)

### From Motion Design to Video Editing

* **March 2023:** Made $0. Worked with a self-improvement creator for free (cold email)
* **April 2023:** First paying client — $50/video, raised to $80 after overdelivering

### Almost Quit (June 2023)

Working full-time hours. Making $500-600/month. Had been trying for TWO YEARS.

Saw 16-year-olds making hundreds of thousands dropshipping.

**What kept me going:** If I quit, I'd have wasted 2 years.

---

## Phase 4: The Breakthrough (June 2023 - February 2024)

### Twitter Launch (June 2023)

Set a challenge: post on Twitter daily for 30 days. Started landing clients.

* **August 2023:** Made $2.5K
* Started treating myself better (clothes, food, apartment, stopped pirating software)

### The $700 DM (August 2023)

Got a DM on Twitter from a creator. First video: $700. They agreed immediately — no negotiation.

**The signal:** Their budget wasn't the constraint. My skill was.

### The Grind Period

* Stuck around $2K/month for a while
* Productivity issues (procrastinating until late afternoon)
* **January 2024:** Made $4K (more client work, tighter deadlines)

### The Breakthrough (February 2024)

* Made almost $7K
* Joined The Editing Lair
* Zero revisions on a video — V1 was basically perfect
* Dropped boxing to focus on deep work mornings

---

## Phase 5: Going All-In (February 2024 - September 2024)

### The $2K Raise (Late February 2024)

Sent the message asking for $2K/video. Was shitting myself.

Two days of silence. Then: "$2K per video ✓"

**The transformation:**

* Dropped other clients
* $4K/month across 5 clients → $8K/month with 1 client
* Working less, more fulfilled
* "It felt like bliss"

### The Complacency Trap (April-May 2024)

Got comfortable at ~$7K/month. Stopped posting on Twitter for 3-4 months.

**Lesson:** Even with a stable client, keep building brand.

### The Missed Deadline (June 2024)

Missed a deadline by 3 days at $2K/video.

Client: "We're paying you so much money for every video, and you still can't deliver on time."

**Never missed a deadline again.**

### The $2.5K Raise (Late 2024)

Client raised rate to $2.5K/video. Didn't even ask.

That's what happens when you keep improving quality without being asked.

---

## Phase 6: New Perspectives (September 2024 - December 2024)

### Thailand Trip (September 2024)

Travelled to Thailand. Met interesting people. Gained new perspectives.

**Realizations:**

* Had been playing it safe
* Needed to think bigger
* Travel opens up new perspectives

This trip sparked the idea for Full-Time Editor.

### Major Decisions

* Dropped out of university
* Went all-in on editing and coaching
* **December 2024:** Hit $10K in one month from editing only

---

## Phase 7: Full-Time Editor Era (2025)

### The Freedom Year

2025 was a "fuck you" to all bedroom editors:

* Spent entire year travelling
* Stayed with editor friends constantly
* Moved to Bali with Oskar (first coaching student, now best friend)
* Villa with Oskar and Guilherme

### The Kickboxing Fight

* Trained for kickboxing fight in Bali
* Professional coach, $60/session, 5-6x per week
* **Flew mom and sister to Bali to watch the fight**
* Lost the fight, but amazing experience
* Paid for 3-week family holiday afterwards

### Investing in Growth

* Invested $25K in mentorships in 2025
* Built Full-Time Editor into a real business

## On Business

* Quality over quantity (1 great client > 5 mediocre ones)
* Inbound beats outreach
* Never drop your price

## On Life

* Storytelling
* Pacing
* Graphic design
* Attention to detail
* Adopting the viewer's perspective

# Section 6: What Worked

## Studying People Better Than Me

Bought project files from top editors. Dug deep into how they made things happen. Recreated effects frame by frame. This made me improve faster than tutorials ever could.

## Building in Public

Posting work on Twitter. Showing the process. Letting the work attract clients instead of cold outreach.

## Going All-In on One Client

Dropping 5 mediocre clients for 1 premium relationship. Building depth instead of breadth. Becoming irreplaceable.

## Treating Revisions as Coaching

Not taking revisions personally. Asking why. Finding patterns. Eventually not needing the "cheat sheet."
