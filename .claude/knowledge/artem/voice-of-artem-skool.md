## The Skool Voice in 30 Words

Artem's Skool posts feel like he's talking to friends in a room. Shorter than email. Skimmable in a feed. Casual, vulnerable, direct. Emoji numbers for lists. Engagement-first — comments over clicks.

## How Skool Differs From Email

Skool is a community feed, not a private inbox. The reader is scrolling, not sitting with your message:

- Even shorter paragraphs than email — every line must be skimmable
- Emoji numbers (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣) for scannable lists — this is the key difference from email
- Titles matter — they're the first thing people see in the feed
- More vulnerability is on-brand ("I'm kinda nervous about it")
- Posts end with engagement prompts, not links
- Feels like a community announcement, not a 1-on-1 conversation

## Structural Rules

### Titles

- Short and punchy
- Can use ellipsis for curiosity ("Something new is dropping Feb 14...")
- Lowercase unless proper noun
- No clickbait — deliver on the promise

### Paragraphs

- 1-2 sentences max per paragraph (even shorter than email)
- One thought per line
- Generous whitespace — feed posts need breathing room

### Lists

- Use emoji numbers (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣ 5️⃣) for structured lists — makes posts scannable
- One item per line
- Keep list items short (one line each)

### Emphasis

- Arrow (→) before key info or CTA — same as email, ONE per post max
- NO bold formatting
- Use spacing for emphasis

### Engagement Prompts

Every post should end with an invitation to engage:

- "Drop a comment."
- "Reply if you have questions."
- "I wanna know who's paying attention."

These replace the email-style CTAs. Skool is about community interaction.

## Language Patterns

Same as email voice:

- Contractions: gonna, wanna, it's
- No hype words: amazing, incredible, life-changing
- No guru energy
- Direct, warm, thinking out loud
- Colons before lists and explanations

### Skool-Specific Patterns

- More vulnerability than email — share nervousness, uncertainty, behind-the-scenes feelings
- "People in this room" / "people in this community" — creates belonging
- Can reference existing members directly ("If you're already inside Full-Time Editor...")

## Post Types

### Announcement / Tease

Short. Mysterious. Builds curiosity without revealing everything.

```
Title: Something new is dropping Feb 14...

I've been building something I've never done before.

And I'm kinda nervous about it.

It's for a very specific type of editor:

1️⃣ Someone who's in this community
2️⃣ Someone who knows they're capable of more, but feels stuck in the same spot.

[continue with tease, end with engagement prompt]
```

### Launch / Offer

Concise. Details up front. Emoji numbers for what's included.

```
Title: The Breakthrough is live.

[Reference previous tease post]

[One-line description of the offer]

[Key details: price, spots, deadline]

Here's what you get:

1️⃣ [Item]
2️⃣ [Item]
3️⃣ [Item]

[After details + no lock-in note]

[Link]

[Disclaimer for existing members if applicable]

Reply if you have questions.
```

### Disclaimers

When promoting new offers in a community with existing paying members, add a respectful disclaimer:

"If you're already inside Full-Time Editor — you're my priority. Nothing changes for you. This is a 30-day trial for editors who aren't ready for the full program yet."

## What to Avoid

- NO walls of text — posts get skipped in feeds
- NO bullet points with dashes (use emoji numbers instead)
- NO bold text
- NO emojis in body text (only emoji numbers for lists)
- NO multiple links — one link per post max
- NO corporate tone
- NO "just checking in" or passive voice
