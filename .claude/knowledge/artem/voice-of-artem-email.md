# VOICE OF ARTEM — EMAIL

Email-specific voice patterns for Full-Time Editor sales communications.

This file extends the core `voice-of-artem.md` with patterns specific to email. Load both files when writing emails.

## The Email Voice in 30 Words

Artem's emails read like he's thinking out loud and you get to overhear. Direct but warm. Short lines. Generous spacing. One clear ask per email. No fluff, no hype.

---

## How Email Differs From Other Content

Email is more intimate than social content. The reader is alone with you in their inbox:

- Even more casual than X/Twitter posts
- Shorter paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- More "I" statements, fewer "you" directives
- Feels like a text from a friend who happens to have useful information

---

## Structural Rules

### Greetings

**First email in a sequence:** `Hey {{name}},`

**Follow-up emails:** `{{name}},` (no "Hey")

This mirrors how you'd actually text someone. The first message is a greeting. Follow-ups are continuation.

### Paragraphs

- 1-3 sentences max per paragraph
- One thought per paragraph
- Let ideas breathe with whitespace

### Lists

- 3-5 items max
- One thought per line
- NO bullet points or dashes
- Just line breaks

```
✓ Correct:

What did you make last month? Last 3 months?
What are you charging per video?
How many clients do you have?

✗ Incorrect:

- What did you make last month/last 3 months?
- What are you charging per video?
- How many clients do you have?
```

### Emphasis

- Use `→` before the primary CTA or key question (ONE per email max)
- NO bold formatting in email body
- Use line breaks and spacing for emphasis instead

```
→ Watch it here.

→ If you haven't watched the video I sent yet, watch it now.

→ What does that actually cost you?
```

### Sign-Offs

Match the sign-off to the email's tone:

| Sign-off | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| "Looking forward to it." | Warm, first email, anticipation |
| "See you tomorrow." | Direct, reminder emails |
| "Talk soon." | Neutral, most common |
| "See you in 60." | Ultra-short, 1-hour reminders |

Always just "Artem" (no dash, no hyphen, no "- Artem")

## Language Patterns

### Contractions

Use casual contractions to match speaking voice:

- "gonna" > "going to"
- "wanna" > "want to"
- "it's" > "it is"
- "that's" > "that is"
- "I'm" > "I am"

### Sentence Starters

**Use frequently:**
- "Here's the deal:"
- "Here's how it works:"
- "Just a heads up:"
- "The more... the more..."
- "That's all I ask."

**Avoid:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Just checking in"
- "As per my last email"
- Any corporate/formal openers

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- "quick chat" (not "brief call")
- "straight up" (not "honestly" or "frankly")
- "the real one" (for emphasis)
- "worth paying attention to"

**Avoid:**
- "amazing" / "incredible" / "life-changing"
- "exclusive" / "limited time"
- Hype words in general

## Email Structure

### One Ask Per Email

Every email has ONE thing they need to do:

- Watch the video
- Think about this question
- Show up ready

Never stack CTAs. If you have multiple things, pick the most important one.

### The Thinking Out Loud Pattern

Artem's emails often follow this structure:

1. State something direct
2. Add context or a question
3. Answer or reframe
4. Connect to the reader
5. Clear ask

```
Example:

I want you to think about something before we talk:

What has actually changed in the past 6 months?

Not what you've tried. Not what you've learned. What has actually changed in your income, your clients, your situation?

If the answer is "not much"... that's worth paying attention to.

Come ready to be honest about where you are.

That's all I ask.
```

### Call Details Block

Keep it simple. No bold headers.

```
Your call:

{{appointment.start_time}}
{{appointment.meeting_location}}
```

---

## Reframes That Convert

These questions/framings work well in nurture and sales contexts:

### "What has actually changed?"

Creates awareness of stuckness without being preachy.

```
What has actually changed in the past 6 months?

Not what you've tried. Not what you've learned. What has actually changed in your income, your clients, your situation?
```

### "What happens if nothing changes?"

Creates urgency through cost of inaction, not artificial pressure.

```
What happens if nothing changes?

If you're in the exact same position 6 months from now. Same income. Same clients. Same frustrations.

→ What does that actually cost you?
```

### "Difficult questions = real progress"

Frames honesty as valuable, not uncomfortable.

```
I'm not asking this to pressure you.

I'm asking because difficult questions are where the real progress is made.
```

### "I'd rather you not join"

Establishes with-or-without-you energy. Shows you're selective.

```
If it's not a fit, I'll tell you straight up. I'd rather you not join than join, spend your money, and not get the best results possible.
```

## What to Avoid

### Formatting
- NO bold text in email body
- NO bullet points with dashes or asterisks
- NO headers with colons and bold (like "**Your call:**")
- NO emojis (unless very rare and intentional)

### Tone
- NO hype or superlatives
- NO artificial urgency ("only 3 spots left!" unless true)
- NO guilt-tripping
- NO guru energy
- NO "just checking in" follow-ups

### Structure
- NO walls of text
- NO multiple CTAs
- NO long paragraphs
- NO corporate sign-offs

---

## Subject Line Patterns

### Formats That Work

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Direct question | "quick question before our call" |
| Specific number | "the $2K/video question" |
| Curiosity gap | "one thing I forgot to mention" |
| Time-based | "12 hours from now" |
| Pattern interrupt | "this might sound weird" |
| Continuation | "re: your call tomorrow" |

### Rules

- 4-8 words
- Lowercase (unless proper noun)
- No periods
- No emojis
- Personal, not promotional
- Never clickbait — always delivers on the promise

---

## Preview Text Patterns

Preview text is the snippet shown after the subject line in inbox view.

### Rules

- 40-90 characters
- Complements subject line (doesn't repeat it)
- Creates curiosity or continues the thought
- Often written as a fragment, not a complete sentence

### Examples

| Subject | Preview |
|---------|---------|
| "just booked — quick video inside" | "3 minutes, worth watching before we talk" |
| "12 hours from now" | "one question to sit with before we talk" |
| "no pressure, just curious" | "noticed you went quiet" |
| "quick heads up" | "something changed for next week" |
