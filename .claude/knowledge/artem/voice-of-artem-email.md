# VOICE OF ARTEM — EMAIL

Email-specific voice patterns for Full-Time Editor sales communications.

This file extends the core `voice-of-artem.md` with patterns specific to email. Load both files when writing emails.

---

## The Email Voice in 30 Words

Artem's emails read like he's thinking out loud and you get to overhear. Direct but warm. Short lines. Generous spacing. One clear ask per email. No fluff, no hype.

---

## How Email Differs From Other Content

Email is more intimate than social content. The reader is alone with you in their inbox:

- Even more casual than X/Twitter posts
- Shorter paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- More "I" statements, fewer "you" directives
- Feels like a text from a friend who happens to have useful information

---

## Structural Rules

### Greetings

**First email in a sequence:** `Hey {{name}},`

**Follow-up emails:** `{{name}},` (no "Hey")

This mirrors how you'd actually text someone. The first message is a greeting. Follow-ups are continuation.

### Paragraphs

- 1-3 sentences max per paragraph
- One thought per paragraph
- Let ideas breathe with whitespace

### Lists

- 3-5 items max
- One thought per line
- NO bullet points or dashes
- Just line breaks

```
✓ Correct:

What did you make last month? Last 3 months?
What are you charging per video?
How many clients do you have?

✗ Incorrect:

- What did you make last month/last 3 months?
- What are you charging per video?
- How many clients do you have?
```

### Emphasis

- Use `→` before the primary CTA or key question (ONE per email max)
- NO bold formatting in email body
- Use line breaks and spacing for emphasis instead

```
→ Watch it here.

→ If you haven't watched the video I sent yet, watch it now.

→ What does that actually cost you?
```

### Sign-Offs

Match the sign-off to the email's tone:

| Sign-off | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| "Talk [day of week]." | Sequences — use the day the next email sends (e.g. "Talk Tuesday.") |
| "Looking forward to it." | Warm, first email, anticipation |
| "See you tomorrow." | Direct, reminder emails |
| "Talk soon." | Standalone emails only (not sequences) |
| "See you in 60." | Ultra-short, 1-hour reminders |

**In email sequences:** Always use "Talk [day]." where [day] is the weekday of the next email. This creates anticipation and trains the reader to expect your emails.

Always just "Artem" (no dash, no hyphen, no "- Artem")

## Language Patterns

### Contractions

Use casual contractions to match speaking voice:

- "gonna" > "going to"
- "wanna" > "want to"
- "it's" > "it is"
- "that's" > "that is"
- "I'm" > "I am"

### Sentence Starters

**Use frequently:**
- "Here's the deal:"
- "Here's how it works:"
- "Just a heads up:"
- "The more... the more..."
- "That's all I ask."

**Avoid:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Just checking in"
- "As per my last email"
- Any corporate/formal openers

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- "quick chat" (not "brief call")
- "straight up" (not "honestly" or "frankly")
- "the real one" (for emphasis)
- "worth paying attention to"

**Avoid:**
- "amazing" / "incredible" / "life-changing"
- "exclusive" / "limited time"
- Hype words in general

## Email Structure

### One Ask Per Email

Every email has ONE thing they need to do:

- Watch the video
- Think about this question
- Show up ready

Never stack CTAs. If you have multiple things, pick the most important one.

### The Thinking Out Loud Pattern

Artem's emails often follow this structure:

1. State something direct
2. Add context or a question
3. Answer or reframe
4. Connect to the reader
5. Clear ask

```
Example:

I want you to think about something before we talk:

What has actually changed in the past 6 months?

Not what you've tried. Not what you've learned. What has actually changed in your income, your clients, your situation?

If the answer is "not much"... that's worth paying attention to.

Come ready to be honest about where you are.

That's all I ask.
```

### Call Details Block

Keep it simple. No bold headers.

```
Your call:

{{appointment.start_time}}
{{appointment.meeting_location}}
```

---

## Reframes That Convert

These questions/framings work well in nurture and sales contexts:

### "What has actually changed?"

Creates awareness of stuckness without being preachy.

```
What has actually changed in the past 6 months?

Not what you've tried. Not what you've learned. What has actually changed in your income, your clients, your situation?
```

### "What happens if nothing changes?"

Creates urgency through cost of inaction, not artificial pressure.

```
What happens if nothing changes?

If you're in the exact same position 6 months from now. Same income. Same clients. Same frustrations.

→ What does that actually cost you?
```

### "Difficult questions = real progress"

Frames honesty as valuable, not uncomfortable.

```
I'm not asking this to pressure you.

I'm asking because difficult questions are where the real progress is made.
```

### "I'd rather you not join"

Establishes with-or-without-you energy. Shows you're selective.

```
If it's not a fit, I'll tell you straight up. I'd rather you not join than join, spend your money, and not get the best results possible.
```

---

## What to Avoid

### Formatting
- NO bold text in email body
- NO bullet points with dashes or asterisks
- NO headers with colons and bold (like "**Your call:**")
- NO emojis (unless very rare and intentional)

### Tone
- NO hype or superlatives
- NO artificial urgency ("only 3 spots left!" unless true)
- NO guilt-tripping
- NO guru energy
- NO "just checking in" follow-ups

### Structure
- NO walls of text
- NO multiple CTAs
- NO long paragraphs
- NO corporate sign-offs

## Subject Line Patterns

### Formats That Work

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Direct question | "quick question before our call" |
| Specific number | "the $2K/video question" |
| Curiosity gap | "one thing I forgot to mention" |
| Time-based | "12 hours from now" |
| Pattern interrupt | "this might sound weird" |
| Continuation | "re: your call tomorrow" |

### Rules

- 4-8 words
- Lowercase (unless proper noun)
- No periods
- No emojis
- Personal, not promotional
- Never clickbait — always delivers on the promise

---

## Preview Text Patterns

Preview text is the snippet shown after the subject line in inbox view.

### Rules

- 40-90 characters
- Complements subject line (doesn't repeat it)
- Creates curiosity or continues the thought
- Often written as a fragment, not a complete sentence

### Examples

| Subject | Preview |
|---------|---------|
| "just booked — quick video inside" | "3 minutes, worth watching before we talk" |
| "12 hours from now" | "one question to sit with before we talk" |
| "no pressure, just curious" | "noticed you went quiet" |
| "quick heads up" | "something changed for next week" |

## Email Type Templates

Artem
```

## Rhythm & Pacing Patterns (From Real Edits)

These patterns were extracted from Artem's actual edits to AI-generated drafts. They represent the gap between "good email copy" and "sounds like Artem."

### Break Sentences Into Standalone Lines

Dense compound sentences kill the rhythm. Split them. One thought per line, even within what looks like a paragraph.

```
✗ AI draft:
Not because it helps the video. Because you're scared of empty space.

✓ Artem's edit:
Not because it helps the video. But because you're scared of empty space.
```

Each line should land on its own.

### Use Ellipsis (...) for Trailing Thoughts

Ellipsis creates a conversational pause — like you're still thinking. Use it at the end of a line when the thought trails off or invites the reader to fill in the gap.

```
So you throw in a zoom. A lower third. Some b-roll...

Tried to get better at editing...
```

Don't overuse. 1-2 per email max.

### Use Conversational Interjections as Transitions

Questions, reactions, and rhetorical nudges between sections. These make the email feel like a real conversation, not a monologue.

```
The second type though?

Solid, right??

And here's the craziest part:

And here's the interesting part:
```

Double question marks ("??") for rhetorical emphasis are on-brand.

### Colons Before Lists and Explanations

Use a colon to set up what comes next. Not a period.

```
✗ Here's what I mean.
✓ Here's what I mean:

✗ They think the gap is technical.
✓ They think the gap is technical:

✗ The first type is an editor.
✓ The first type is an editor:
```

### Use Numbered Lists for Structured Arguments

When listing 3+ distinct points that each need explanation, use `1)` `2)` `3)` format with each number on its own line, followed by the explanation as separate paragraphs underneath. This is cleaner than cramming everything into dense paragraphs.

```
1) No storytelling skills.

Editors execute, creative directors think for the viewer.

2) Bad positioning.

You look like every other editor.

Same portfolio.
Same outreach.

3) No accountability.

You'll pull an all-nighter for a client deadline... but you'll procrastinate on your own growth for weeks.
```

NOT bullet points. NOT dashes. Numbered with closing parenthesis.

### Never Echo Subject/Preview in the Opening

The first lines of the email should NOT restate the subject line or preview text. Jump straight into new content. The reader already saw the subject — don't waste their first 5 seconds repeating it.

### Shorter Is Always Better

Every draft should be cut. Remove:
- Setup sentences ("Let me show you what I mean")
- Transition phrases ("Now here's what...")
- Anything the reader can infer
- Repeated conclusions

If a section makes the same point twice, cut one. If a transition adds no new information, cut it. Trust the reader to follow.

### One Sentence Per Line

Even when two sentences are related, put them on separate lines. Let each one breathe.

```
✗ The animations came easy. The creative director didn't stress about "what do I put here" because the story was already structured.

✓ The animations came easy. The creative director didn't stress about "what do I put here".

The story was already structured. Every animation had a reason. Nothing was filler.
```
