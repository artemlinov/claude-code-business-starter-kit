## The Newsletter Voice in 30 Words

The most intimate platform. Personal stories wrapped around actionable value. Story-driven frameworks that feel like a conversation over coffee, not a lecture. Raw, generous, and deeply personal.

## How Newsletter Differs From Other Content

Newsletter is more intimate than social, more personal than YouTube, and more value-dense than email sequences:

- Longer form than tweets — room to breathe and tell full stories
- More personal than YouTube — the reader opted in to hear from you
- Story-first structure — frameworks are wrapped in personal narratives
- Value-dense — every edition teaches something actionable
- Not sales-focused — this is relationship-building content

## Newsletter Structure

Every edition follows this flow:

1. **Hook** — Personal story or contrarian statement
2. **Story** — The journey, the struggle, the insight
3. **Framework** — The actionable takeaway
4. **Bar** — Memorable closing line
5. **PS Section** — CTAs (2nd most-read part after hook)

## Newsletter CTA Structure

**PS Section (2nd most-read part of email):**

```
PS. If you want my personal help scaling to $5-10K/month, apply here: [landing page link]

PPS. If you're not ready for that but want to connect with other editors, join my free community here: [Skool link]
```

**Mid-newsletter soft CTA (optional):**

```
This is exactly what we work on inside Full-Time Editor.

If you're stuck at $1-2K/month and ready to change that, check it out here: [link]
```
