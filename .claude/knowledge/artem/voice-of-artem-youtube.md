# VOICE OF ARTEM — YOUTUBE

YouTube-specific voice patterns for Full-Time Editor video scripts.

This file extends the core `voice-of-artem.md` with patterns specific to YouTube. Load both files when writing scripts.

---

## The YouTube Voice in 30 Words

Intentional, polished, premium, Apple-like. "Simplicity is ultimate sophistication." Provide as much value as possible while turning viewers into lifelong fans by building deep connections and bringing them into the Full-Time Editor cult.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. One Message, Reinforced

Every video reinforces the same Core Philosophies: Storytelling First™, Quality over Quantity, The 4-2-1™ Rule, etc. Different topics, same underlying philosophy. This compounds trust.

### 2. Premium Feel Through Effort

Viewers can feel the effort through the screen. Higher production signals: "If he puts this much care into free content, imagine what the paid stuff is like."

### 3. Hook Obsession

The first 15 seconds determine everything. Must accomplish:

* Trey-style observation question or bold opinion
* Validation of their frustration
* Contrast (where they are vs. where they could be)
* Clear promise of what they'll learn

### 4. Scripted, Not Stiff

Write scripts but deliver naturally. The goal: sound like you're speaking off-the-cuff, but every word is intentional.

### 5. Value-First, CTA-Light

Don't hammer sales. Be generous with value. CTAs go in description and brief mentions (around 4-5 min mark for lead magnet, end for apply link).

### 6. Progressive Framework Reveal

When introducing proprietary frameworks (Three S's™, Twist & Stick™):

* Tease early — name it without fully explaining
* Reveal progressively — each component tied to a story beat
* Complete the loop late — full recap only at the end

---

## Hook Formats

### 1. The Trey-Style Observation Question (PRIMARY)

Points at something the ICP has noticed but can't explain. Opens a curiosity loop.

```
Why do some editors charge $2K/video while others struggle to hit $2K/month?
```

```
Why do the editors working the hardest seem to make the least?
```

Always follow with:
1. **Validation** — "You've seen it..." or "I was there too..."
2. **Contrast** — Show the person who has what they want
3. **Concept** — The one word/idea that explains the gap (e.g., "leverage")
4. **Promise** — What the video delivers

### 2. The Contrarian Flip

Open with what most people believe, then challenge it.

```
Most video editors think:

Improve first, raise prices later.

Reality: it's the opposite.
```

### 3. The Specific Number Hook

Lead with a specific, attention-grabbing number.

```
$5K/month video editing is:

– 1 client, not 5
– 4 hours, not 12
– 5 videos, not 25
```

### 4. The Direct Statement Hook

No preamble. Straight to the point.

```
Spend more time picking music instead of learning Blender.

Please.
```

### 5. The Relatable Anecdote Hook

Start with a personal story your audience can identify with.

```
In June 2023, I almost quit editing...

Full-time hours. $600/month.

I almost gave up to start dropshipping.
```

### 6. The Intriguing Question

Pose a question that resonates with the ICP's internal monologue.

```
What's the difference between $1K/month and $10K/month video editors?
```

### 7. The Teaser Hook

Give a glimpse of what's coming without revealing everything.

```
90% of video editors don't use this storytelling trick:

Story Proof™.
```

### 8. The Promise Hook

Offer a clear benefit for consuming the content.

```
This took me 2 years to figure out.

I'll teach it to you in 2 minutes.
```

### 9. The "X% Don't Know" Hook

Combines shocking statistic with promise of insider knowledge.

```
90% of video editors don't use this storytelling trick.

But it's the difference between videos that feel amateur and videos that feel premium.
```

**Hook Enhancement Principles:**

* Use "I" and "I've" to breed vulnerability
* Include specific numbers whenever possible
* Keep the first line under 10 words when possible
* Create a curiosity gap that demands resolution
* Promise value specific to the Full-Time Editor ICP

## How He Builds Arguments

**The Dichotomy Framework:**

Present two clear paths. Make the right choice obvious.

```
Good video editors focus on the look of the video.

Great video editors focus on the feel of the video.

Look: deep glow, 3D animations, flashy backgrounds.

Feel: pacing, storytelling, sound design.
```

**The Simple Math Proof:**

Use basic arithmetic to make points undeniable.

```
$5K/month = $1,250/week
```

**The Timeline Story:**

Show progression with specific dates and numbers.

```
My first inbound was $200/video.

Next week, $300.

In two weeks, $350.

Three months later, I had my first $1K project.
```

**The Us vs. Them Contrast:**

Constantly reinforce what separates Full-Time Editors from everyone else.

```
Hustle bros of the editing world:

– Automations that remove creativity
– Replaceable by a cheaper editor
– Fifteen deadlines next week

Full-Time Editors:

– Two high-paying clients.
– Delivering premium work.
– Living life in the meantime... not outreaching.
```

**The Volume vs. Leverage Contrast:**

```
When your entire business model is "edit more videos," you have zero leverage.

You can be replaced by two editors who are slightly slower than you.

But the editors charging premium rates? They compete on depth, not volume.
```

---

## How He Uses Examples & Analogies

**Construction/Building Metaphors (for storytelling vs. flash):**

```
Most editors are building houses with no foundation.

They add fancy windows and a fresh coat of paint.

But the structure is weak.
```

**Garden/Butterfly Analogy (for organic growth):**

```
Outreach is you chasing butterflies.

Branding is you building a garden.
```

**Cheat Code Analogy (for revisions):**

```
Revisions are literally a cheat code.

Most editors copy the final answer and throw away the sheet. They make the change the client asked for, ship the video, and move on.

But they never ask why. Why did the client want this change?

The editors who gain leverage? They study the solutions. They find the patterns. They start thinking like the client thinks.
```

**When to Use Analogies:**

* Explaining counterintuitive concepts
* Making abstract frameworks tangible
* Breaking limiting beliefs
* Creating memorable teaching moments

---

## How He Closes

**Option 1: CTA Close** — Platform-specific calls to action (see CTA Structure below).

**Option 2: Bar Close** — A quotable, hard-hitting line that sticks in people's heads.

**The Reframe Bar:** `Work-life separation, not balance.`

**The Math Bar:** `$5K/month is 5 videos, not 25.`

**The Dichotomy Bar:** `Defensive editors get fired. Learning editors become irreplaceable.`

**The Identity Bar:** `That's what makes a Full-Time Editor.`

**The Permission Bar:** `You can have a life AND make $5-10K/month.`

**The Leverage Bar:** `That's what leverage looks like.`

**Bar Principles:**

* Keep it under 10 words when possible
* Make it quotable, shareable, screenshot-worthy
* No CTA needed after a strong bar

---

## YouTube-Specific Transitions

* `So how do you build it?` — Transition to teaching
* `The question is...` — Set up the next section
* `But here's the thing. At this point...` — Add complication to story
* `And that's when I understood...` — Reveal moment
* `But I still had one more lesson to learn. And I learned it the hard way.` — Tease upcoming failure story

---

## Tension-Building Patterns

**The Wait Pattern:**

```
I hit send. And then I waited.

One day. Nothing.

Two days. Still nothing.
```

**The Uncertainty Admission:**

```
I wasn't panicking exactly — I knew they probably wouldn't drop me. But I didn't fully believe they'd say yes either.
```

**The "That Felt Insane" Marker:**

```
$2K per video. That felt insane.
```

**The "Still Remember This" Specificity:**

```
Then the next video — I still remember this — I got zero revisions.
```

## Transformation Narrative

### The Before/After Arc

**Before (what they recognize):**

* $1-2K/month despite working full-time hours
* Skilled but stuck
* Imposter syndrome about rates
* Doubting if editing is viable
* Juggling multiple low-paying clients

**After (what they aspire to):**

* $5-10K/month working 4-6 hours/day
* Confident in their rates
* Premium clients reaching out to them
* The 4-2-1™ lifestyle
* Full-Time Editor identity

**How to reference the transformation:**

```
The gap between you and $5K/month is smaller than you think.

I went from $50/video to $2K/video. Not by working harder. By working on the right things.
```

## YouTube Voice Examples

### The Perfect Hook (Trey Style)

```
Why do the editors working the hardest seem to make the least?

You've seen it. Editors grinding 60 hours a week, juggling five clients, optimizing their workflow down to the minute — and they're still stuck at like $2K/month.

Then you see some guy with one client, charging per video what most editors make per month, who's actually able to enjoy life on top of that…

What does he know that you don't?

It comes down to one word: leverage.
```

### The Perfect Tension Build

```
I typed a message on WhatsApp, read it back a few times, finally hit "send."

And I'm not going to lie — I was shitting myself.

One day. Nothing.

Two days. Still nothing.

I wasn't panicking exactly — I knew they probably wouldn't drop me. But I didn't fully believe they'd say yes either. $2K per video. That felt insane.

Finally, they replied...
```

## Vlog Music Direction

Vlogs are raw, authentic, documenting-the-journey style — NOT polished/premium like main channel videos.

- **Default vibe:** Lo-fi Hip Hop, Indie Folk, Acoustic, Bedroom Pop, Singer-songwriter
- **Fast-paced montages:** Liquid Drum And Bass — fast but smooth and uplifting, never dark or aggressive
- **Avoid:** Cinematic, Corporate, Phonk, Hard Trap — anything too produced or too aggressive
