# VOICE OF ARTEM — YOUTUBE

YouTube-specific voice patterns for Full-Time Editor video scripts.

This file extends the core `voice-of-artem.md` with patterns specific to YouTube. Load both files when writing scripts.

## The YouTube Voice in 30 Words

Intentional, polished, premium, Apple-like. "Simplicity is ultimate sophistication." Provide as much value as possible while turning viewers into lifelong fans by building deep connections and bringing them into the Full-Time Editor cult.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. One Message, Reinforced

Every video reinforces the same Core Philosophies: Storytelling First™, Quality over Quantity, The 4-2-1™ Rule, etc. Different topics, same underlying philosophy. This compounds trust.

```
My channel is about one thing:

Helping video editors scale to $5-10K/month by attracting their dream clients.

Every video reinforces that.
```

### 2. Premium Feel Through Effort

Viewers can feel the effort through the screen. Higher production signals: "If he puts this much care into free content, imagine what the paid stuff is like."

### 3. Hook Obsession

The first 15 seconds determine everything. Must accomplish:

* Trey-style observation question or bold opinion
* Validation of their frustration
* Contrast (where they are vs. where they could be)
* Clear promise of what they'll learn

### 4. Scripted, Not Stiff

Write scripts but deliver naturally. The goal: sound like you're speaking off-the-cuff, but every word is intentional.

### 5. Value-First, CTA-Light

Don't hammer sales. Be generous with value. CTAs go in description and brief mentions (around 4-5 min mark for lead magnet, end for apply link).

### 6. Progressive Framework Reveal

When introducing proprietary frameworks (Three S's™, Twist & Stick™):

* Tease early — name it without fully explaining
* Reveal progressively — each component tied to a story beat
* Complete the loop late — full recap only at the end

---

## YouTube-Specific Transitions

These transitions work specifically in video scripts for maintaining flow between sections:

* `So how do you build it?` — Transition to teaching
* `The question is...` — Set up the next section
* `But here's the thing. At this point...` — Add complication to story
* `And that's when I understood...` — Reveal moment
* `But I still had one more lesson to learn. And I learned it the hard way.` — Tease upcoming failure story

## The Trey-Style Observation Question Hook

This is the PRIMARY hook format for YouTube. Points at something the ICP has noticed but can't explain. Opens a curiosity loop.

```
Why do some editors charge $2K/video while others struggle to hit $2K/month?
```

```
Why do the editors working the hardest seem to make the least?
```

Always follow with:
1. **Validation** — "You've seen it..." or "I was there too..."
2. **Contrast** — Show the person who has what they want
3. **Concept** — The one word/idea that explains the gap (e.g., "leverage")
4. **Promise** — What the video delivers

## YouTube Voice Examples

### The Perfect YouTube Hook (Trey Style)

```
Why do the editors working the hardest seem to make the least?

You've seen it. Editors grinding 60 hours a week, juggling five clients, optimizing their workflow down to the minute — and they're still stuck at like $2K/month.

Then you see some guy with one client, charging per video what most editors make per month, who's actually able to enjoy life on top of that…

What does he know that you don't?

It comes down to one word: leverage.
```

**Why it works:**

* Opens with observation question (Trey style)
* Validates frustration ("You've seen it...")
* Creates contrast (grinding editor vs. successful editor)
* One word concept ("leverage")
* Opens curiosity loop

### The Perfect Tension Build

```
I typed a message on WhatsApp, read it back a few times, finally hit "send."

And I'm not going to lie — I was shitting myself.

One day. Nothing.

Two days. Still nothing.

I wasn't panicking exactly — I knew they probably wouldn't drop me. But I didn't fully believe they'd say yes either. $2K per video. That felt insane.

Finally, they replied...
```

**Why it works:**

* Shows the action clearly
* Vulnerable admission ("shitting myself")
* Builds tension with waiting
* Acknowledges uncertainty
* Creates relief when answer comes
