# Alex Garcia Sound Design Guide

---

## Sound Design Philosophy

**Approach:** Minimal-intentional. Sound should support, never compete. Each sound is deliberate — if you can't explain why it's there, remove it.

**The Rule:** If you're adding sound to make it feel "edited," don't.

## Music

When the video needs tension, weight, or cinematic gravity.

**Genres (Epidemic Sound):**
- Cinematic (Drama, Suspense, Build)

**Moods:**
- Mysterious
- Dramatic
- Suspenseful

**Usage:**
- Intros that set up a big idea
- Transition moments between major sections
- Building to a key reveal or insight

---

### For Value Sections / Teaching Moments

When Alex is explaining frameworks, breaking down concepts, delivering the core content.

**Genres (Epidemic Sound):**
- Dark Jazz
- Contemporary Jazz
- Nu Jazz

- Downtempo (Chillout, Chillwave, Trip Hop)
- Ambient
- Lo-fi Hip Hop
- Hip Hop Soul

### What to Avoid (Music)

**Genres:**
- Corporate / Easy Listening / Lounge (too generic)
- Epic / Adventure / Action (too dramatic for teaching)
- Pop / EDM / House (too energetic, too commercial)
- Comedy / Quirky (wrong tone entirely)

**Moods:**
- Happy (too light)
- Funny / Quirky (too playful)
- Epic / Euphoric (too dramatic)
- Busy & Frantic (too chaotic)
- Peaceful (can feel too passive — use Laid Back instead)

**General:**
- Music that competes with Alex's voice
- Tracks with prominent vocals
- Anything that feels like "background music for a YouTube video"
- Corporate ukulele or whistling
- Generic "chill beats to study to"

## Sound Effects

### SFX Style

**Description:** Analog, vintage, cinematic — subtle and intentional. Each sound should feel like it belongs in an indie film, not a YouTube explainer.

### Search Terms (Epidemic Sound)

**Camera & Film:**
- Contax shutter / Contax T2
- Leica shutter
- 35mm camera
- Film advance
- Polaroid eject
- Medium format shutter

**Tape & Analog:**
- VHS tape insert
- Cassette deck
- Tape rewind
- Reel to reel
- Tape hiss
- Vinyl static

**Clicks & Mechanical:**
- Zippo lighter flick
- Typewriter key (single)
- Clock tick
- Light switch
- Dial click

**Subtle Whooshes:**
- Slow whoosh
- Short whoosh
- Fabric whoosh
- Soft swish

**Low-End Impacts:**
- 808 sub hit (deep, not punchy)
- Kick drum (deep)
- Distant thunder
- Subwoofer rumble

**Texture Layers:**
- Room tone
- Vinyl static
- Film burn (audio)
- Analog hum

### SFX Usage Rules

**When to use SFX:**
- Transitions between major sections
- Emphasizing a key moment or insight
- Scene changes or chapter breaks
- Very sparingly on text (only if it's a major point)

**When NOT to use SFX:**
- On every text pop-up
- To fill silence
- To make something feel "edited"
- When the content is already strong on its own

---

### What to Avoid (SFX)

- Cartoon sounds
- Comedy SFX
- Whooshes on every text
- UI clicks on graphics
- Risers (unless for specific dramatic builds)
- Bass drops
- Aggressive glitch effects
- Gaming SFX
- Anything labeled "bright," "sharp," or "punchy"
- Anything that sounds digital or synthetic

---

## Section-Specific Guidance

### Intros

- Music: Cinematic, dramatic, strings — builds tension and stakes
- SFX: Intentional, sparse — maybe a film camera sound, a subtle low hit
- Feel: Serious, composed, purposeful
- **If the intro feels "cool," it's wrong. If it feels inevitable, it's right.**

### Value Sections (Teaching/Frameworks)

- Music: Dark Jazz, Nu Jazz, Downtempo — supports focus without distracting
- SFX: Almost none — let the content breathe
- Feel: Sophisticated, calm, signal-focused

### Transitions

- Music: Can swell slightly or change tracks
- SFX: One intentional sound — tape stop, film advance, subtle whoosh
- Feel: Clean break, not jarring

### Outros / CTAs

- Music: Can lift slightly in energy but stay sophisticated
- SFX: Minimal
- Feel: Confident close, not desperate push

## The Sound Litmus Test

Before adding any sound, ask:

1. **Can I explain why this sound is here?** If not, remove it.
2. **Does it feel like an indie film or a YouTube compilation?** If compilation, remove it.
3. **Would a luxury brand use this sound?** If it feels cheap or generic, find an alternative.
4. **Is silence better?** Often, yes.
