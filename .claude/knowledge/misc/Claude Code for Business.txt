What if AI did 80 to 90% of the work in your business and all you have to do is just review that output? I'm not talking about using a chatbot where you copy-paste things. I'm talking about actual real AI systems that could run on your behalf. AI systems that read your files, connect your tools, and execute real work your way, following your process, in your voice. That's what Claude Code makes possible. And the crazy thing about it is that you do not need to write a single line of code.

Now, real quick, if you notice, this video is quite long. So, if you don't have the time to watch this video in its entirety, I recommend for you to save it so you can learn to implement Cloud Code later. Because by the end of watching this video, you'll know exactly how Cloud Code works and you'll know how to implement it into your workflow so it can get 80 to 90% of the work done in your business. So, you can focus on the higher leverage work as a business owner. You know, the work that'll pay you $1,000 an hour or more.

First, I'll show you how Cloud Code works in a visual way so that you can understand the building blocks and how you could use it in your business. Then I'll walk you through step by step how to get started with Cloud Code with a starter kit on GitHub that you can get in the link in description. This is the exact way I use Cloud Code to do real work in my business. Finally, I'll show you live how I build a real AI system on Cloud so you can see exactly how all the pieces connect and how you could potentially use it in your business to regain hours and contribute actual value in your business.

Your first question as a business owner is probably why Cloud Code? How does it actually work and how's it different from other AI and automation tools? So if we were to map on an axis, high autonomy as in the tool is actually able to do work for us with us just asking it to do it, and how easy it is to set up, Cloud Code would be at the top right, and that is where we want to be as a business owner. We want to be able to tell something to do it and it does the work the way that we want it done.

Now if you compare it to other tools, let's say ChatGPT. ChatGPT is pretty easy to set up but it doesn't do the work for you. It just answers back some questions. It might be able to write some text but that's it. Now if you compare this to N8n and Zapier, there is improved agent capabilities but the problem with these tools is that we need to build every path like node one, node two, node three, node four. While we could just ask Cloud, it could figure out the plan, what are the things that need to get done, and it will actually do the work for you.

Then there's tools or SDKs like LangGraph, Google ADK and Crew AI which still allow us to have high autonomy, but the problem is that it takes weeks of building and as business owners we do not want to spend weeks technically building and coding on Python and doing all that stuff. Ideally we want to be using something that is out of the shelf that we could ask it to build something and it's able to build an AI agent very quickly and start doing work as soon as possible for us so we can regain back more time and leverage.

Now the best thing about Cloud Code is that I know there's code in it, it can actually code for you. But when you connect it to external tools and you give it specific agent skills, it can actually do work for you. You do not need to build infrastructure for these agents to work, the orchestration and so on. Cloud Code will do that all for us which is we can thank Anthropic for that for building all the infrastructure. So simply describe in plain English what you want and Cloud will build it, whether it's coding or whatever digital assets you want it to build for you. So you basically get developer level power without being a developer and that is a complete game changer as a business owner.

So let me show you how it works exactly. So if we were to take a normal AI chatbot, which is how most people use Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT, it would look, you know, on a rudimentary level, it would be you as a user sending a prompt or a question or sending text to the language model and then the language model takes your text, it reasons, and then it gives you a response back. So this is how most business owners are using AI. Now, if you're using AI right now in this way, well, you're technically going to be doing all of the work in your business because AI is just being a consultant for you or a very smart advisor. In this case, you're probably just chatting with AI as a chatbot and you're just copy-pasting all the time.

Sam Altman predicted that soon we're going to be seeing one person billion dollar companies. And he's not wrong. Now is the best time to build a business based on leverage, specifically AI agents and digital assets. And if you're watching this, you probably think so, too. That's exactly why I have a daily newsletter called the Chief Leverage Officer. Every day, I'll share actionable insights on how I'm building a AI million dollar one-person business. The thinking behind the systems, what's working, what's not, and where AI leverage is headed. If you want to build a business that runs without you, not by hiring a team, but by building AI leverage, that's what I write about. Links in description, and if you're watching this, I highly recommend it.

Now, what makes Cloud Code different is that Cloud Code is not a chatbot. Now it has other capabilities which makes it agentic. So Cloud Code actually works under your local files and it can actually code for you. It can run commands for you and it could do actual work in your computer just as if you are interacting with your computer. Cloud Code can somewhat interact with your computer. While with a chatbot you're just getting text responses. With Cloud Code you're asking it to do something and it actually does things.

So Cloud Code in its essence is an agent. It's a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment to achieve a user-defined objective. That means you can give it a goal and AI can reason, plan, and execute on the actions to achieve that goal and fulfilled tasks. And what makes it even better is that you can give Cloud Code access to the external world via MCPs and APIs. So this is why Cloud Code is not just a coding agent. It can code things. Yes, it can build tools like coding tools, Python scripts, but it can also interact with the external world which makes this a game changer as a business owner because now you can give AI some work and it can interact with your Notion and it can do work for you as an example.

And the best thing about this is that we do not need to code. Again, Cloud Code has very good orchestration. All we need to do is give it the right prompt and it will do the work for us. Cloud will do the thinking. It will interact with our files. It will use MCPs, APIs, and track to the external world. It will do that work, come back and then tell you what work it got done. So, this is what an agent does and this is how you want an employee to work in your business. You tell them what to do and it does the work by itself.

Now, a quick caveat here. This can also extend to how other LLMs work. So, this doesn't need to be only Cloud Code. This could be Gemini CLI or Codex. The only thing that we're swapping is a language model. So regardless if you're watching this video, if you use a different AI model, the concepts I'm sharing here can still be transferable to any other type of AI model that you have. And this is why it's very important to understand these concepts because if you understand how your files are structured and how MCPs work, APIs work, and how you an agent work, this gives you the power to use to swap out any language model in the future.

Now the next thing I want to go over is I want to go over how Cloud Code works visually so that later on in the walkthrough you understand what's going on with Cloud Code. So on the left side we have you the user and you can interact with Cloud Code in two ways. You could either give it a prompt which could be like a question or the way or just ask it to do something, or you can have it packaged into a slash command. I like to think of slash command kind of like a button and when you click this button, it runs a prompt that you had previously or a workflow that you want Claude to do specifically. So instead of you asking Claude to do something over and over again, you could package that into a slash command and Claude can read that and then interact with your files and tools and do that work predictably.

Now the thing about AI, AI doesn't come itself with memory. So AI is just the brain. So here's where we need to give Claude the memory. So in Cloud Code, the memory is in a cloud.md file. So within the cloud.md file is where we store the information about our workspace and where Claude can find the tools and files. So all the routing rules, memory is on here. So when you give the prompt to Claude, it has this memory attached to it. So that kind of like a map. So it knows how to interact with your files and tools to execute that task for you.

Now you might have some stuff in your files and tools or your codebase or project base that you don't want Claude to touch. So here's where you can have hooks which is kind of like can act as guard rails. Or if you want Claude to interact in a specific way, we can have hooks to tell Claude how to do something. So every time the Claude runs a tool or something, it has a hook to it. And then the best thing about this is that your files and tools, we can store skills or agent skills.

Now, if you don't know what agent skills are, I actually recorded a full video on that in my YouTube channel. I put in the cards above and the link in description below if you want to learn more about skills. But what skills does, it pretty much gives AI a playbook on how to do work in your business or like a standard operating procedure. Now this is game changer because AI right out of the box won't know how to do things in your business, but when you give it skills it can actually do work predictably in the way that you want it to get done and can create value in your business that in tandem with MCP which is external connections to the external world. It can interact with external world and now can actually create value for you.

You can have slash commands which can act as buttons if you want Cloud Code to work a specific workflow. You have a memory cloud.md file that tells Cloud how to do things. You have hooks, so if you don't want Cloud Code to touch specific things. You have agent skills which teaches AI how to do work. And you have MCP connections which allows Cloud Code to interact with external world and deliver actual value in your business.

Now the way Cloud Code works is that Cloud Code has a context window. There's a limit to how many messages you can send Cloud Code. So if you've ever used Cloud and you notice that you're out of messages and it compacts, there's a reason for that. It's because Cloud uses processing power to process text and the more text you give Cloud Code, the more processing power it requires and it exponentially increases after a certain point where at some point it's not financially logical to continue the same context window when it's much better to just compress the window by creating a summary and then spawning a new agent.

Now this is important because when you're working with Cloud Code if you are working with one main agent and it's always summarizes, summarizes, summarizes, the context that you've given at the first agent is going to be completely lost by the third or fourth cycle. So in order to maintain performance our goal is to try to maintain a clean context window. Okay? Because over time the performance of an AI model degrades as you give it more context. So there's research on this. It said that 11 out of 12 models drop below 50% at 32 context and then at around 100K is when things start getting worse and around 150K is where you probably will get unreliable outputs. So if you find Cloud Code not giving you good outputs, it's likely because you're giving it too much context.

This is why it's very important that we use sub agents. So what Cloud Code can do is that ideally you want to use it as an orchestrator where you spawn sub agents because each sub agent will have a fresh context window. So instead of going through the cycle where you work parallel with one single agent, you probably will get 90% better results with a multi-agent approach. Not only do you save context where the agent performs better, but you also get more work done because you have other sub agents doing smaller tasks.

So this is why when you're working with Cloud Code, if you're working on a big task or big project that has a lot of context, you need to explain it. Ideally, you want to use the main Cloud agent that you're speaking with as a planning agent that you ask it to spawn sub agents to do the work for you and to have the main agent review the work that the sub agents does. Because if you were to use the main agent, the ones you're talking with to do all the work and plan and strategize, the chat window will compact and like you'll compact multiple times and you're going to get frustrated because you by the requirements you shared with them in the start, they don't know what it is because they're working on a summarization of a summarization.

So this is why it's important to understand how sub agents work and when to use them and when to spawn them when needed. This will also help you in terms of designing which sub agents to do specific types of tasks and how you could have them all connect together. And this is a very important concept because context engineering right now is going to be very important in terms of getting AI agents to do predictable work that is accurate in your business, at least for now until they fix the context window, and once AI has unlimited memory then we're going to be talking completely different game then.

Now the way Cloud Code spawns sub agents is that you could ask it in your prompt or in a command to spawn the sub agent and then it'll go ahead and spawn the sub agent and prompt that sub agent on what it needs to do. And because sub agents also have access to your files and MCP or the external world, it can actually do real work in your business as well. And Cloud Code can spawn as many sub agents in parallel as you want it to.

Now, big caveat here. If you're not on the max plan, if you're going to spawn sub agents on the pro plan, you're likely going to use up all your usages for the week. So, I recommend using the Cloud max plan if you are going to plan to spawn a lot of sub agents. And the great thing about sub agents is that if you know how to set them up, you'll probably get, let's say, what would you get done in a week, probably done in like 10 minutes because sub agents can do all the work for you.

Now, a core pillar that allows agents to do real work in your business is agent skills, which is basically playbooks that your agents can run in order to do specific tasks in your business. Now, if you're again, if you're unfamiliar with agent skills, I did record another video, a full breakdown. I put the link in description and the cards above. You can check that out. But basically, in your files, you want to have a set of skills that you could have that agents could quickly pull up like playbooks and run them.

So, the way this works is let's say you have a skill on YouTube research. You'd ask, "Hey, can you research this video idea for me?" Whatever the video is. Claude is going to think, "Okay, video." It's going to scan through this Claude skills folder. It's going to find the one that matches, which is YouTube research. And then it's going to load that. It's going to load only the skill. Now, the reason why we wanted package in the skill is because package skills allows Claude to only get what is relevant to the specific task and not pollute the context window. Because if Claude were to read all of this as like one single prompt, it would pollute the context window and then it would compact and it wouldn't be as efficient with work.

So pack so skills is kind of like packaged prompts, instructions, everything in one place to do a specific task predictably. So Claude will scan the YAML front matter which is pretty much kind of like the title and the description and then once it matches the keyword that we asked it for which is researchers video it will pull up that skill. So for example, research this video will pull up the YouTube research skill. It'll have the skill that .md file over here with the name YouTube research, description analyze videos for insights, tools YouTube MCP, Notion MCP, with the instructions.

So now the agent will know how to do this task. It will know that it will use these two tools and it will have instructions on how to do it specifically and the prompt on how to think about it on how to do the analysis and so on. And then we give it access to Notion and YouTube. Now the agent can actually do real valuable work because you've given it access to tools. You've given it access to instructions and how to do things specifically in your business and what to do with that information. And then once it does all this work, it can then save that, let's say this research plan or this research analysis into your folder. So now you can actually see the folder and interact with it. And if there's anything wrong with the folder or with the research, you can prompt it again to say, "Hey, look up this keyword, check this, run this with another skill that you want." So now skills stack upon each other and you could work with agents kind of like an employee doing work for you in your business.

Previously, in order to run a business as a business owner, you'd call yourself a CEO, but I like to call that as chief everything officer. So you'd be in charge of everything. You need to do everything yourself or review everything yourself. Content, research, reports, email, scheduling, data entry. You'd probably be doing at least some of these tasks yourself. if you don't have delegated and even if you have delegated you probably will have to do some of this stuff as a CEO because you need to manage things in your business. So this will likely take you 40 hours a week.

Now because Cloud Code exists, you can Cloud Code can be your CEO. So now Cloud Code does the things that you were doing before. So content, email research, reports, scheduling, data entry, Cloud can do that. So what would take you 40 hours a week now Cloud Code can probably do 36 hours of that and you just take it just takes you four hours of your time where you just direct it and give it feedback on what to do. So you can pretty much get the same output of what you did before with 10X less of your time. So this is why using Cloud Code is one of the highest leverage things you could do as a business owner and it starts by understanding how Cloud Code works.

So with that being said, let's dive into the walkthrough. Real quick. If you find this video helpful, I'm running a paid three week cohort called Your First AI Employee, where our goal is to turn Cloud Code into an AI employee in your business that generates you at least $10,000 a year in value. We're going to X-ray your business to find where AI would fit. Then, we work to build your first AI employee that saves you at least 10 hours a week and generates you $10,000 a year. This isn't going to be a generic system. It's going to be one built customized to you, your process, your standards, and your voice. If you'd like to join me and other business owners, links in the description and there's limited spots I accept every month.

Okay, so the best way for us to get started to learn how Cloud Code works is for us to build something live. So, we're going to build a YouTube breakout analysis, which is our goal is to have Claude spawn sub agents that will scrape through the all of YouTube with specific keywords, will find the breakout videos, which is specific videos that have a ton of views for the channel that has smaller amount of subscribers. That's why they're called breakout views. So, we can take that data and we could then use that to position our videos to get the most amount of views possible.

So, here's how it's going to work. So, I'm going to ask Claude, "Hey, research this video idea for me," which whatever video idea it is. And then Claude is going to be able to go through Claude. It's going to understand what skills we have and then it's going to run through the YouTube research skill which we're going to build together. And then it's going to connect to the YouTube MCP as well. And then it's going to spawn sub agents called YouTube researchers which with specific keywords that will then look up YouTube. They'll get their own results and then they'll give it back to the main Claude or the orchestrator agent and then let us know which videos performed best. So that's what we're going to build. So let's dive in.

All right. So in order for us to get started, the first thing we need to do is we need to download Visual Studio Code. So we can go ahead and download it. It's completely for free. Or if you prefer flexibility and you potentially would like to use Gemini, you can download Google Anti-gravity. So, both of these are really good options. I'm going to go ahead with Visual Studio Code because a lot of the extensions that I use work perfectly on Visual Studio Code and some of them don't quite work that well on anti-gravity.

So, once you have VS Code installed, the first thing we need to do is we need to install the Cloud Code extension. So, we go to extensions on the left side and then what we're going to do here is we're going to search Claude and then we're going to go ahead and install it over here. Okay. So, you're going to get a prompt over here that's going to show you how to use Cloud Code. You can go ahead and read this. I'm just going to click on mark done because I'm already familiar with Cloud Code.

Now, the next thing I'm going to do is I need to clone a get repository because if I just start working Cloud Code or VS Code, I don't have a folder open here. So, and if you open up a empty folder, Cloud will still work, but it won't have the basic infrastructure that Cloud works with. So, I actually created a Cloud Code business starter kit which has all of the infrastructure in order to get Cloud Code to work right away. Instead of you needing to do go through the trial and error trying to get things set up, reading the developer documents, I put it all neatly over here. So, you can go ahead and grab this from the link in the description below and you can get started there. The instructions on how to set it up are over here, but I'm going to go through step by step right now.

So, I'm gonna grab this link. I'm going to grab this link and I'm going to go to Visual Studio Code. I'm going click clone GitHub repository. Clone from URL. I'm going to go ahead and open it up to where I have my YouTube walkthroughs. I'm going to select repository as destination. Okay. So, I'm going to click open and boom, it opened up the folder. So if you look in the left side, if we open this up, we can see the cloud folder. So the cloud folder is where we have the things that Claude works with. So agents, so if we have custom agents, commands like I explained previously and then skills. So I created some skills already so that if you want to create an agent, if you want to build anything, you can ask Claude and it will already know the correct format in order to create these things. So I did that.

So there's skills and then there's the settings.json which is where hooks stay and what gives permission for what Claude Claude to do. So these are the permissions that Claude has that could work in this folder which is read, glob, git, bash and so on. And then there's hooks. So every time a new skill is created or renamed, Claude will update the cloud.md file. So the cloud.md file again is the explanation on how this repository works. And this Claude file is given to every single Cloud agent. So then the Cloud agent will know exactly how to work in this code space or knowledge base if you like to call that.

Again markdown files are just text files. If you're not a developer and you're confused what .md stands for, just think of it as like a text file that is written in a specific format. So these hashtags are kind of like headers. Two hashtags like a header. Asterisks are kind of like bold. So it just looks like that. So if I want to read this in a more in a way that is more friendly, I can click on control shift V, click on it all together and it's going to open up a preview. Okay, so technically this is just a prompt. If you just look just like a nicely formatted prompt. So we work with AI via prompts.

So if I look through this claude.md, this is what every Cloud agent will get. So it will understand how the directory works, the routing. The number one important thing here with working with AI is routing because when AI agents start to work, we want them to understand where to find the things to do the work properly. The last thing you want is AI to not have the context to do the work correctly and then it does a completely wrong output. So this is why it's important to have the routing because when AI knows the routing, it can look for the right tools to do the right amount of work or the right context to do the right work.

Okay. So routing over here if you want to create a skill or use these skills and so on and then it'll go over the folder structure which looks like so and MCP servers will be configured on MCP JSON. I want to do a quick recap before I go through the walkthrough so you can understand what's going on and you don't get lost. So the cloud folder is pretty much a so the .cloud folder is where we're going to store our agents. So custom agents or sub agents, commands which is the buttons on or like packaged prompts that we want Cloud to do work predictably. Skills which is agent skills which is packaged SOPs, knowledge playbooks and then the hooks configuration.

Now it's in a .cloud folder because this is what allows Claude to automatically discover these tools and to have Claude work on it immediately instead of us having it stored in a different file format. This is automatically stored when Claude is launched. So whenever I open a new cloud or a new agent or I have multiple agents, all these agents will be reading the cloud folder immediately. Okay, similar with the cloud.md folder as well.

And then at the bottom there's a a option to work with plan mode or normal mode. So I can switch between those those modes by clicking shift tab on my keyboard. Now, you want to use plan mode when you are building stuff because you want Claude to sort of interview you and pretty much go through Claude on all of the requirements and what you're going to build step by step. That way, you do not make mistakes because if you just ask Claude to do something, it's not going to have the context to do it the way that you wanted to do to do it. So, plan mode is very helpful.

Now, once once you're done with plan mode, you can click shift tab again and then you can toggle between asking Claude to plan or asking Claude to just do the work already. So, if I want to get started, what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on cloud open over here. Because I already have Cloud configured on my VS Code, I can just get started. If this is the first time you're sending this up, you're going to be prompted over here to log in. All you need to do is use your cloud.ai subscription. You do not need to use the API. So, if you already have a subscription to Cloud, just log in following the instructions over here.

So, our goal again like I mentioned is we're going to build a YouTube breakout researcher. And let's see how what we build. So, let's start. "Hey, Claude. My goal is to build a YouTube breakout researcher. In order for us to get started, we're going to need to get access to YouTube MCP. So, the goal is this. I want to I want you to find an MCP server that is capable of finding a YouTube channel, their views, their subscriber count, and when the video was published, and potentially any other requirements for us in order to find their breakout score. So, a breakout score is basically the number of views divided over the number of subscribers on the channel. So ideally, we want to identify videos that have the highest breakout scores so we could model our videos on those videos so we can get the most amount of traffic to our channel. Does this make sense?"

Okay. So, I'm going to get started by asking Claude to find an MCP server because if we don't have the MCP server, then we can't really find the breakout videos. So, it went ahead. It understood and it's calling the create MCP skill. So, I'm going to do that. In the meantime, I'm going to open up a new chat over here and we're going to do two things at once. So, I'm going to ask Claude, "Hey Claude, I'd like to work on building a skill where specifically we scrape through YouTube to find breakout videos."

"Now, a breakout video is a video that has substantially more views than a number of subscribers. Ideally, we want to find find out breakout videos that have a 2X score or more. Now, here's how the skill is going to work. I'm going to give you a video idea and from that video idea, I want you to find five core angles or five core perspective shifts. And then from those core perspective shifts, I want us to identify five keywords for each core angle or perspective shifts. Then once we get through all those keywords, the next thing I want to do is I want us I want us to spawn a sub agent for each one of those five keywords that will be searched in parallel. And then later on, I want you to consolidate all of that information and create a report for us."

"Now, specifically, I want you to make sure that the videos that we look for are at least five minutes or longer and are not shorts. We do not want YouTube shorts because we post long form video. So, five minutes or longer only. And I want you to create this where it's a phased based process where you ask me where we approve the keywords and so on so that we can work on in case we want to make any adjustments."

Okay. So I'm going to have that work and I'm also going to tell it, "By the way, we're currently setting up the MCP. So don't worry about that for now. We're working on that in parallel."

Okay. So now I'm going to go back over here and it's going to look for... Okay. So, it's spawning an MCP finder agent to search the best YouTube MCP server options. So, I have this agent already set up over here called MCP-finder. So, Cloud already knew that this existed. So, it's running this custom agent. Okay. So, while it's running, it's going through the skills and it's actually creating the skill. So, I'm going to go ahead and stop this very quickly.

And what what I'm gonna say is "I want to do this plan. So can we do can we do what I shared earlier but plan it together?" Okay. The reason why I'm going to do plan here which I forgot about it. So Cloud Code has three different options. It has the normal option which you just ask it it will start building things. Then there's a plan mode. So in this case, creating a new skill, plan mode would be best because then we do not want Claude to make assumptions. We want Claude to create a plan. We review it and then we work.

So it's asking me right now for the parallel search, should each of these five sub agents search all five keywords for their angles or should we respond 25 agents, one for keyword? 25 agents would be way too much. So I'm say five agents. "How many breakout videos should we aim find per angle or keyword?" I would say top three to five per angle is good. Sometimes it's really hard to find 10. "What should the final report include? Video details, title views, subprocesses." I'm going to go ahead and say, "Yeah, we can do all this. I would say the most important important is the title templates so that we can brainstorm different ways we can implement our core ideas into those title templates and then future have the option to download the thumbnails so we can use those as inspiration."

So I'm going to click enter. "Where should the research agent output itself?" "Research YouTube breakout video idea." I think that's fine. Submit answer. Okay. So, let's see here. It actually is web searching and looking at these GitHub repositories over here to find the MCP servers. So, let's see here. "For title template, should we extract exact pattern struct from breakout video titles? Show both templates and actual give templates plus real titles for contexts." "Yes, both." "For the breakout zero calculation should be be strict about 2X minimum short range?" "Uh 2X only show tiered results categorize breakout level." I like that. "Should the skills save thumbnail URLs only or actually download the image files?" "Download. Yeah, let user decide."

Okay. "What should happen if you want to modify the angles or keywords during approval? Interactive edit. You suggest changes are regenerate. You directly edit a person list and continue." Okay. Interactive edit. "After five agent after the five agents finish searching parallel. Should I show you raw results before consolidating?" Okay, I'm going to say "Share with me the consolidated report, but also compile all of the agent results into a consolidated folder, consolidated file." So, I'm click submit answer.

Okay, so the MCP finder agent is still looking. Okay, perfect. "Now I have a complete picture. Let me summarize the complete workflow. We'll build phase one, phase two, phase three, phase four, phase five." Okay, so output structure. So it's going to create a new folder where it's going to create these outputs for us. So it organizes it for us. "Does this capture everything correctly? Any adjustments before I start building?"

Okay, so it found the best MCP server for our use case. So I'm going say "Yes, let's go ahead. Yes, let's go ahead and install this MCP." So because this MCP server is on GitHub, I believe it'll be able to set up. So now Cloud is telling me that I need to get an API key. So I can follow these instructions. "Go to Google cons. Go to Google Cloud Console." So if I click on that, it will pull up my Google Cloud. So I'm now on my Google Cloud. If I go back, I need to go to click a new project, enable YouTube data API, create API credentials, and so on. So I'm going to go ahead and skip this. So I'm just going to copy over the API and we'll get started.

All right. So I got the API key. I'm going to share it and then Claude is going to configure the MCP for us. Okay. So it went ahead and it created an MCP folder over here and it added the API key. So I'm going click on yes. So if I go to MCP.json, we could see the API key over here and then we could see the MCP that we're using. So this is how Claude gets access to the external world via the MCP.json file over here. Go ahead and close that out.

Okay. So it seems like this agent is still planning. Okay. So apparently it says it recognized the MCP server is connected. So the way that I could check if an MCP is set up correctly. I could type /MCP manage MCP servers. Continue in terminal and it's going to open up a new terminal. So click on enter. So it is actually connected. So yes proceed. So I can type MCP. So we have two MCP servers. It seems like project MCPS and YouTube. So, and Notion which is I connected globally on my computer. So, that's good. So, we're all set.

So, it ask "Are we done configuring MCP?" Okay. So, now it's asking me, "Do you want Claude to use YouTube MCP tools without asking permission each time?" I'm going to say yes. Because we're going to use sub agents in the future. If we do not add this, then the sub agents will fail. So, I'm going to say yes. So what's going to happen here in the settings.json right now we have read glob git bash bash it's going to add those tools within that MCP server that Claude can edit.

Okay so it created over here MCP YouTube underscore asterisk. Hopefully this will work. If if it doesn't work then we'll likely have Claude to actually put in the real tool names over here. Okay. So, let's go back here and let's click on yes. So, it's going so it's checking what tools are available from the MCP so we can build the agent properly. Let's see what happens. So, you'll notice that Claude will ask you. You can just say yes, allow if you want it to stop asking you for permissions on yes.

So, I'm going to ask "If we're done setting up the MCP here." Okay. So, apparently we'll need to reload and test, but I think the MCP servers are already working. So, I'm going to ask, "Can you test searching for a breakout video for business for productivity? Sorry. Uh, productivity for business owners." Click enter and let's just see if it works. If not, then we'll have to restart to get the MCP to work.

All right. So, this agent just finished searching how to use all the tools. So, apparently, it's going to update the tools needed. So, it identified all the tools we needed. So, and it in the plan folder. So, meanwhile, while that's working, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to restart Cloud Code because the MCP servers aren't quite the YouTube MCP server isn't quite connecting. So, in order for me to do that, I'm going to click control shift P and I'm going to type reload, reload window. And what's this going to do? It's going to pretty much refresh Visual Studio Code. So, I'm going to ask it to test again.

Sometimes MCP servers are quite like miseratched. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. So this is why we need to test it. Okay, let's continue. So this is why using the plan mode is very helpful because Claude can get all of the context and put it into a a plan folder which is over here Claude plans. And when you work in a different when you compact when the window compacts or you're working with a new agent, we can continue. So looks like the MCP server is connecting. So it actually worked when we restarted it. And over here it says that we already have it permissions set up. So it's going to verify the settings and then continue building.

Okay. So it's going to create the YouTube breakout search agent now. So I'm going to do this. I'm going to ask "Can you make sure to read create agent skill before creating the agent so that I want I want them to I want Claude to build it right the first time instead of us going back and forth." So I'm going to make sure ask it to reference it because sometimes again this is an example of context. Like even though like Claude might have read it at the start of the chat over here, it went through my whole codebase, it still forgets things. So this is why I make sure to remind it.

So it went ahead and updated it. So hopefully it will work. Okay. So we'll know if it works if I type slash and I'll be able to see it. So, if I put type /YouTube to not if I put type /save to notion, I still don't see that. So, we're going to we're going to check it now once it creates it. So, I'm going to go ahead and refresh reload window so that if the command is working, we'll be able to see it.

Once Claude creates the slash command, I can open up a new chat and I can type /save and I should be able to see it. So, save YouTube to Notion. If you don't see it, then you always again you want to make sure you reload the window or you make sure that Claude actually created the command correctly. So I'm going to click on this save tab and then I'm going to make sure that I select the actual report. So I'm going to ask it to Claude Code business productivity because let's say you have multiple reports and you want one specific report and you don't want another report. So you want to specify.

So I asked save YouTube to Notion cloud code business productivity and Claude said "I'll save the breakout videos from YouTube research to Notion. Let me find let me first find the most recent research report." So I was going to go ahead and save all 12 videos. So let's do this. Let me see if I could open this up so we could see it work at the same time. Put on Notion here and all right. So, as you see, it just added all of the videos in one shot. That's sick. That's so cool. And then I want to make sure the thumbnails are shown. So, great. Even the thumbnails are here. Awesome.

So now it's going to add the next three videos which is the 5X tier. So if I work with Notion, I can always go here to property visibility and I can put out the breakout score and I can put in the channel number of subscribers. So I can adjust what I want. I can put the the URL as well and I can even sort it based on breakout score or views. So, I'm going to do by breakout score. So, apparently this one got the highest breakout score for this title and this thumbnail, right? So, you can now use this as an analysis. So, yeah, this is sick. This is awesome. Now, you could get work done and share it with your team on Notion by connecting YouTube and Notion MCP.

So, in less than an hour, we built a complete AI system that gets YouTube breakout videos for us. Now, what would happen if you spent three weeks in building AI systems and how much more you could get done? That's exactly what I'm doing in a new challenge called Your First AI Employee which I'm running on February. Our goal is to first X-ray your complete business. So we're going to find opportunities where you could use AI agents in Cloud Code and then we're going to delegate those activities to Cloud Code so Cloud Code can become an actual employee in your business. And ideally, this employee will generate value in your business and generate business outcomes where at minimum, our goal is to have Cloud Code generate you $10,000 a year extra in value generated or revenue generated.

Now, if you want that, I put that link in description. We're going to get started soon, and I'm only taking 10 spots. And if you found this video valuable and you want to apply what we just did, you can re-watch this video again, and you can grab the GitHub repository starter link in the description below. And a like and subscribe would be very helpful. I'll see you guys in the next one.
