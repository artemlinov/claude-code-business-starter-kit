Just about a month ago, Anthropic released this feature called Claude Skills. I've been using it for the past month, and it completely transformed how I get work done in my business, allowing me to automate work that would take me around 30 minutes, sometimes an hour, to get done in just around five minutes.

In this video, I'm going to give you a complete breakdown on how to use Claude Skills in your business. First, I'm going to show you the difference between skills, projects, and just using Claude normally. Second, I'll walk you through how to create a skill using the Claude web app. I'll go over some examples on how you'd want to use Claude Skills. And finally, at the end of the video, I'll show you how you could use Claude Skills within Claude Code so you can empower agents or use these skills with Claude Code to get more work done autonomously. By the end of this video, you'll learn exactly how to use Claude Skills so you can regain more time and use that time to generate more revenue in your business. And no, you do not need to know how to code. You do not need to be technical. You just need to spend the next few minutes paying attention so you can learn how to set this up for yourself.

So what are Claude Skills? Think of Claude Skills kind of like giving a playbook to someone else to get work done, but instead to AI. Within this playbook, you're probably going to have instructions, maybe some references, examples, standards, guidelines, and so on. Claude Skills acts like a playbook, but to be more technical, a skill is basically just a folder. It is a folder that has a skill.md file. A skill.md file is just a markdown file that has all the instructions and configuration on how to do this specific task or workflow.

Because Claude Skills can act like a playbook, we can treat skills kind of like our playbook library. When you ask AI to do something and there's a playbook on it that exists, let's say for example you ask AI to write a proposal for this client, what AI is going to do is it's going to say, "Which playbook do I need?" It's going to look at your playbook library or your skills and it's going to take that exact playbook which is called proposals. Then from that playbook, it's going to read through that playbook or the skill file and it's going to understand this is how we need to do this task, and then it's going to do the task for you.

This is awesome because instead of needing to copy paste prompts and asking AI to do things step by step, you can have predefined processes or skills in these playbooks that they could pull out from your library and do multiple tasks whenever required. You can have as many playbooks or skills as you want. You can have 10, 20, 30 plus playbooks all listed out in your library, and then AI could reference all of these skills whenever required. The best thing about it is that it will only load what it needs. If you ask it to just write the proposal, it will only reference a proposal playbook. It will not reference everything and lose all of its context where you need to start a new chat. It will only reference what's in that folder to get that specific work done. That means it's very token efficient.

To be more specific, how the skill anatomy looks like or how the playbook looks like is that it's basically a folder, and within the folder we have a skill.md file which is a markdown file. Within the skill.md file, this is going to be the prompt and the instructions. We can also have some more complex folders within our skill folder which are optional that will allow AI to execute more complex workflows. Let's say you need to run code, you can have a scripts folder. Let's say you have templates that you want AI to reference, you can have a templates folder. Or if you have other references that you want AI to look at to reference, you can have folders. You can have as many folders as you want. Whatever is required to execute that skill, you can have that in there. But the most important thing here is a skill.md file. It cannot be a skill unless we have a skill.md file that Claude can read through.

If you're just getting started, I recommend starting simple with just a simple skill that just has a simple prompt that you could put into a skill.md file and then test it out. Then you could test out some other complex skills that will have scripts, references, and templates and so on.

Within the skill.md file is how Claude identifies whether this skill is relevant to the current task. Because when you have all these skills or playbooks in your library, AI is going to quickly read through all of them. It's not going to read through all the context within the skill. It's going to read through the name and the description, which is the skill.md header. What they call this technically is called the YAML front matter, but we don't need to worry about that. You just need to understand that just like how a librarian would look for a specific book to do a specific task, they're going to look for the name of the book and what the book does. Same thing with your AI agent. It's going to interact with your skills by quickly reading the name and description so it knows which skill to use. That's what Claude sees first.

Once Claude identifies that this skill is required, then it's going to read through the instructions and the prompt, which is stored right below. This is again a markdown file. I'm going to go over how this looks like in a moment once I explain completely how skills work. In simple terms, a skill is just a prompt with a header or metadata. And again, the best thing about the skills is that there's automatic routing. You do not need to tell Claude to do a specific skill. You could ask it if you want to be more specific, but Claude is smart enough where it could read through the skills very quickly and then identify this is the skill that's required.

For example, let's say you ask it to write an email about our product launch. AI will quickly understand, "Okay, do I have a skill on that?" It will see, "Okay, there's an email skill." It'll go through the email skill. It will use the email skill, and then within the email skill, you might have a folder that's called product launch templates or examples. This is great because now you might even have a playbook here which is called product launch, and then it's able to do a product launch for you. But again, this is very important. The naming of the skills is very important because you don't want Claude to be confused. If you have email, then you probably want to have an email skill, and then within an email skill you can have a product launch workflow within it. Technically you can have skills within skills. It does work because AI could read through it.

The way skills load is what makes it efficient. You simply ask Claude in a chat to do something, and if there's a skill for it, Claude scans the skills, it picks the right skills, it loads the instructions and then it executes. It's very efficient. It only loads what it needs and the context stays clean. This is the best thing about skills because the old way, if you wanted to do this, let's say you have a skill that has a lot of different parts to it. Let's say you want to write an email. What you do is you probably copy paste the brand guidelines. You copy paste email examples, you copy paste format rules, you copy paste instructions, and if you put all of this into a chat or a context window, you're going to run out of messages very quickly. Then you're going to need to copy paste everything into a new chat. It gets very difficult to work.

When we use skills, what happens is you get all this free output. Claude reads a skill and doesn't take any of the tokens or the context or the messages of that chat. Now it's way more efficient. You can really get work done with skills.

The next question is, what should be a skill? There's two questions. If you answer both of these questions yes, then you should 100% turn it into a skill. Question number one, do you do this task repeatedly? And do you want Claude to follow your specific process? If you answered yes to both these questions, then yes, you should make it a skill.

The best thing about skills is that anything can be turned into a skill. As long as it's a step-by-step process that you want the AI to follow, it can be a skill. Let's say you want to turn email into social posts, that can be a skill. If you want to have an intake form and turn that into a proposal, that could be a skill. If you want to turn meeting notes into action items, that could be a skill. If you want to turn specific content that AI had written and you want to apply your brand voice to that, you can also have a skill for that. Anything that has a process, a specific style or way that you do it can be turned into a skill.

Now, what should you not use for skills? Let's say you want to ask AI what to prioritize. Probably don't need a skill for that, unless you have a prioritization style or process that you do. Then you'd have a skill for that. Review my strategy. You want to ask to review your strategy. Probably won't need a skill for that unless you have a strategy review process. Then you'd have a skill. Problem solving. If you want novel problem solving, probably won't need a skill unless you have a problem-solving framework. Research probably won't need a skill for that unless you have a technique or a way that you do research, then you turn it into a skill. Generally, if the task is repeatable and you want Claude to follow a specific process, framework or style, then you'd have a skill for it.

There's a lot of confusion between how to use skills, projects and just using Claude. To keep things simple, we want to have skills when we want to have AI to act like a trained specialist with a specific process, framework or style. Simple test: if you do this task repeatedly and you want AI to follow a specific process, make it a skill. 

With projects, projects are a little bit different because projects is just going to be a shared knowledge base. This is going to act like reference context within multiple chats. This could be brand guidelines, client database, company strategy. This isn't necessarily a skill. This isn't a process. This is shared reference material. Simple test: is this info needed for multiple different tasks? Then it's a project.

If you just want to use Claude regularly, then probably want to use it as a smart generalist or exploratory thinking. Then you just ask it simple questions and get back and forth judgment. You could use Claude regularly. But generally, at any point, if you have a proprietary way of doing things, a framework, a process, you'd want to use skills.

Let's open up Claude and I'll give you a walkthrough on how to create your first skill. All right. Once you open up Claude, the first thing you want to do to create skills is you need to open up the settings, and then when you go to settings, you want to go to capabilities right over here. Then in capabilities, if you scroll down, you're going to see the skills menu right over here. You want to scroll down. As you can see, I have some skills that I've created. You want to scroll down and you want to make sure you activate skill creator because what this is going to do, this is going to have Claude access to the skill of creating skills. Basically this is going to create the skills or playbooks for you.

Once you have this on, the next step what you could do is click on the three dots here, click on try in chat. "Hey Claude, I just added the skill creator skill. Can you make something amazing with it?" Let's test that out. This is just testing out a skill. Let's see what it does. Now you can see the thinking that Claude is doing. Thinking about creating a skill. Now it's reading the skill creator skill. The cool thing about the skill is that you can ask Claude at any time, "Hey, can you create a skill for this thing?" If you ever find yourself working with Claude and you're making a lot of edits to an email or edits to a piece of content or whatever you're working on and you figure out the correct way to do things, you can ask, "Hey, Claude, can you turn this into a skill?" And then Claude will automatically turn it into a skill for you.

Now, as you can see, the thinking here, it's looking through my workspace. It's giving me some ideas on what skills I could create. Now it's giving me a suggestion, leverage audit skill. That sounds cool. Let's see what it does. Now it's going to go through some reference files in my project and let's see what happens. As you can see here, now it's reading through the markdown file for skill design. There's a skill on creating skills. It's reading through that. As you can see here, it's doing this, but it's not taking the context of the context window. It's like as if I'm starting the chat almost fresh. Still using some tokens here, but it's still working.

All right, I've got the full picture. Solid framework for building skills. Now, here's my thinking on what would be amazing, very specifically. You already have content creation skills. You've been doing frustrating content to AI, brand voice DNA extractor. I do like that. Analyze your existing content and extract specific patterns and make your voice unique. Sentence rhythms, key phrases, storytelling moves, vocabulary creates reference file. Leverage audit framework for your consulting work takes a client through structured assessment of their operations. Looks cool. Content optimizer. Looks cool.

Let's go with the brand voice. Let's create a skill for our brand voice DNA. Before you go ahead, can you let me know what source material or content you're going to use to create this? I asked this question because I want to know what material we're going to be using. YouTube scripts and so on. What I'm going to do here is I'm going to ask it to go through my Notion because I have this connection. I have Claude connected to my Notion. I'm going to ask it to do that. Let's see what it does.

Now Claude is going through my Notion. Let's see if it finds those emails. Now it seems like it's found my emails, my past 10 emails. Perfect. As you can see here, Claude is acting as my agent. I'm giving it instructions and it's able to take action on my behalf. It is able to reason, understand and take action. This is an example of what an agent is. A lot of people don't know what an agent is, or when I first started I didn't understand what an AI agent is. But an AI agent basically is when you ask AI to do something and it's able to understand your instructions, reason and create a plan and then execute, which is what makes it agentic. It's able to make decisions and take action by itself, which is what Claude is doing over here. Because I've given Claude access to my Notion, it's able to look into it and get stuff done.

As you can see, Claude's gotten four emails and needs six more. It is going to take a little bit of time, but let's see where it goes. Also, I'm asking Claude here to do this. I could have made this faster by just uploading the emails, but I wanted to show you guys how this would work. I'll get right back to you guys once this is completed.

It just finished getting all the 10 emails. These are the last 10 emails I've written. Then I think it got a detailed YouTube script. I don't know why. Maybe it failed on the last 10th. But basically, it's creating the skill now. As you can see, it will take a little bit of time to create the skill, but imagine once I get the skill done, every single piece of content that AI writes, I could just say, "Hey, can you apply my brand voice skill to it?" And then it will go through the full skill and then it will look at the text that AI had written and it will be able to transform it into something that sounds more like me. This could magnify in all types of content I create: YouTube scripts, emails, newsletters, content, anything that requires scripting or writing or planning can use this voice. I'll be back again once this is done.

All right, so we're back. If you take a look here, done. Here's what I built. If you look at the skill folder, I don't know why this is not visible. I'm asking Claude to share the skill folder. This is why it's very important to understand how skills work because sometimes Claude does make mistakes. I'm asking it to create a proper YAML header because even if you don't have the YAML header correctly, which is the name of the skill and then the description on what it does, Claude won't be able to detect it. Sometimes Claude makes mistakes. That's why watching the first part of this video is really important, having an understanding of how skill architecture works. Over here I'm asking it to update the skill with proper YAML header, and then I'm asking it to create the folder so I can show you the structure. I'll be back once it's done.

It just finished creating the skill folder. It's called brand voice DNA. There's a skill.md file which is the main skill with YAML header plus six-layer analysis framework. Then it has references and then it has my DNA in the markdown file. This is the skill that we're going to be using. I'm going to double-check and ask it if I use this skill on content that AI wrote, will using this skill transform that content into content that sounds like me? Let's ask it.

In the meantime, these are all the files here. These are all the files within the folder. This is the skill.md file. It's properly structured with a name and then a description. Double-check it here. Yeah, name and then description. There we go. And then the next file is my brand voice DNA, how my content is written with instructions and then brand voice DNA output template. Yeah, this is what Claude did. Ideally you'd want to go into this and actually read through this, make sure whatever is written on here is going to create the output. If you want to test it out and then optimize a skill until it actually does what you want it to do.

It said no. This skill only extracts your voice patterns. It's an analysis tool that creates a DNA file. What you're describing would be separate skills. Something like voice transformer that takes AI-written content and your brand voice DNA outputs written content. Want me to build that as a companion skill? It would reference that. Then let's create a skill.

All right. So I asked it to create a skill for my voice. It collected all the emails and then went ahead and created the skill. It's called Rashid voice, and we can see in the skill over here. If I pull it up, there's a name and then there's a description and then there's exactly how to do this. How to apply my voice to email, social post, scripts, landing pages, any written content should sound like me. The skill is a voice source of truth that other content skills should reference.

Then there's when to use, the purpose and then other instructions over here. Then there's a voice DNA which I think the skill MD file references. When AI reads through this, it will know to reference these files. You can see over here the structure. There is a skill MD file which is basically how Claude knows when to use a skill. Let's go back here, how Claude knows when to use a skill. I might even make it better by changing the name to brand voice or something. But as long as I use voice, it will know when to call this. I could even add it in the description on more instructions, like whenever user asks for "write this in my voice," "write an email in my voice," "turn this social post to my voice," it will be able to use that skill. But I'm going to keep things simple for now. I'll go over that in a minute.

There's a skill and there's references. Within the skill, this skill should potentially reference the other skills that I have in my workspace. I have other skills and so on. Then I could use these references. Here's what we're going to do. You're going to download all. Yes, please. We need to package it into a zip file, and then from the zip file we'll be able to upload it. If that doesn't work because previously it prompted me to add the skill and it worked, but this time doesn't work. This is how you do it.

The next thing I need to do is I need to open up settings. We go to capabilities and then we go to upload skill, and then I could drag and drop. Let's see how it works. I have this folder open. Let's drag it. It needs to be in a zip. So I go to my downloads. Zip file. Drag it in. Let's see. Hopefully this works. Boom. So it's uploaded. Now I could use this whenever. Let's try in chat, and I'm going to do this. I'm going to open up Gemini. I'm going to ask it to write, "Can you write an email on the importance of learning how to use Claude Skills in your business and how it can save 20 hours of your time?"

I'm going to take whatever Gemini wrote and then paste it and then test out the skill. Again, we're doing this live. It might turn out to be horrible, but let's see. Still loading. Just doing this as an example because there's a lot of AI slop content. If this actually works... Oh man, this is the thing. I didn't prompt this really well. I said write an email, so it's assuming they're sending this to a team. Ideally I should say this is going to be like a daily newsletter email sent to my subscribers. Let's do that. But again, not that this can't be applied, not that my voice can be applied, but I want to do this as if I'm writing a daily email. Let's see what it comes up with.

You can see how this email is horrible. It's literally AI slop. Let's see what it does. Boom. Let's see how it works. What's going on here now? It's reading through that skill. It's reading through the skill and it's going to apply the playbook to this email. Let's see how it goes. Now it's reading my voice DNA and email examples for full calibration. Interesting. I'm curious to see how this comes out. What's going on here? It's doing progressive disclosure. It's not loading everything at once. It's slowly progressing and seeing the context as it needs. This is great because instead of wasting all the tokens, it's very smart about the tokens.

This isn't bad. It gave me subject options. You're wasting your $20 a month sub on Claude like a chatbox. Build once, run indefinitely. You're paying $20 a month for Claude. How many hours has it actually saved you? If you're just opening a new chat, typing a prompt, and hoping for the best, you're capping yourself. You're treating a digital employee like a search engine. The business owners who dominate late 2025 aren't prompting AI. They're building Claude Skills.

What's a skill? Think of a standard chat as a casual conversation. Think of a skill as hiring an employee with a specific job description and a handbook. You tell Claude who to be, how to act, what tools to use. Once built, you never explain the context again. You just trigger it. That's leverage. Here's where it gets interesting. Most people are spending two hours every week explaining context to AI. "Remember, I like short sentences." "Don't forget to format the date as..." "Make it sound like me." Every time you do that, you're leaking time. Skills preserve context. They turn one-off tasks into one-click workflows.

I built three skills last week. Here's what happened. See the pattern? Wow. This is really actually good. This is really good. Wow. Holy moly. This is really good. I would actually use this. This is an example of a skill, brand voice. And if you want that, you can get it for free. You can get the voice brand extractor for free below which I just created on the fly. That's how skills work in the web app. Let's dive into Claude Code and how this would work because not only could you use this on the web app, you can also use it in Claude Code which is even more powerful.

This is going to be the most technical part of the video. If this feels a little bit too complicated, don't worry about it. I'm going to be recording other videos in the future explaining how I use Claude Code. But basically to explain, I'm using Cline, and Cline is basically this application that I could have Claude Code access to my files. I have files on my computer and all of my skills, the skill folders are all in my computer. For example, if I open up my Claude file, you see agents core documentation, all these folders. I'm not going to go into it, but I have this folder called skills. Within these skills, I have all of these skills that I have prepared previously.

For example, if I pull up the YouTube strategy, I have the skill MD file. Let me show you how this looks like in a closer look. You can see here we have the name, description, and you can see the description just has many keywords. Whenever I use any of these keywords, it could catch that idea. Then I have workflows for this skill. Instead of having each of these separate as a skill, I can have workflows act as many skills. Whenever I use any of these keywords, AI understands that we need to use this playbook or the skill which is YouTube strategy. If I'm more specific, it'll be able to understand these are the workflows that we need to use.

We have the workflows over here which are other markdown files. Then there's scripts. There's no scripts in this one. Then there's references and so on. For example, these are the types of video titles that I use. That's just an example of a skill.

Let's go back to our brand voice. What I'm going to do is I have Claude Code open. This is Claude Code for VS Code. You could install it with extensions. I'm just using that. I could also use a terminal, but I prefer to use it this way. You guys who are familiar with Claude Code would know what's going on here. People that aren't familiar, don't worry about it. I have another video explaining this.

What I'm going to do is I'm going to take this folder and I'm going to put it into here and I'm going to tell it right now. What I did was I extracted the zip folder and I moved it into my folder. If you can see, it has Rashid voice I just implemented. I'm going to ask it: "I just imported Rashid voice. It's a skill for writing content in my voice. Can we implement it and integrate it into our skills within the Claude folder please? And can we implement routing to our other skills?"

What I'm asking here, because I have other skills that I use, I want to integrate the skill with my other skills because I have skills for writing email in my Claude Code. I have skills for writing YouTube scripts. I'm asking Claude Code to implement it within my workspace. The reason why I prefer Claude Code is because with Claude Code I can have agents, I can have skills, and I can have everything in one place where these skills can daisy chain and connect to each other.

For example, let's say I want to write an email on my email skill. I can have a step of writing an email routed to my skill which is Rashid voice. Or if I write a YouTube script, I can have that skill routed to this playbook. Now everything is routed together kind of like playbooks so that when I ask AI agents or Claude it has everything in one place. It has all the playbooks and it knows which playbooks to use. On Claude web app it can do that, but it's just not as good as here. The best thing about this is I can manually edit the skill folder.

If I go back to YouTube strategy, if I go to the skill.md, if I go on here, I know what's going on. I can go here, I can edit. Let's say I could put some random text. It'd be like, yes, check email is whatever. I could directly edit the prompt on here, while on Claude web app, you can't really edit it unless you download the markdown, you edit it, and then you package it again as a zip file, then you upload it again. It gets really messy. That's why I like Claude Code.

As you can see here, it's going to integrate it into my system. It read through the files. Now it's going to move the skill to here. It's going to integrate email skill. It's going to integrate with my social media skill and it's going to integrate to my YouTube strategy skill. It's going to go through all of this step by step. I'll get back to you once it's done.

Claude Code just linked and routed all of my skills to my voice skill. I'm going to test it out. "I'd like to write an email on the importance of using digital assets and developing digital assets within your business, which could be AI systems, Claude Skills, offer documents, your brand voice, all of the things that create your business is clearly documented into digital asset. This could be a prompt and how that allows your business to be more scalable. I'd like you to write this email." Yeah, just write the email. Let's see what happens.

I wrote that out and I'm just asking it to write an email. What should happen here is that it should go through the email skill which is what I have open here. If you look at the email skill right here in the skill, I have "read Rashid voice skill." It's routed to this. If you could see, it's actually following my instructions, the AI agent. "I'll load your voice skill first, then write this email." Boom. It's as if you're telling an intern or someone on your team to get something done. The AI agent is actually going to read the skill and then it's going to write the email.

It wrote the email. "Your business lives in your head and that's the problem. Every process, every offer, every system you've built over the years, it's all stored in your brain or scattered across random Google Docs and Notion pages nobody looks at. You used to be able to get away with this, but now AI can do 80 to 90% of the work in your business, but only if you give it something to work with. No digital asset equals AI is just a chatbot you talk to. Digital asset equals AI can do real work. Let me explain what I mean by digital asset. Digital asset is anything in your business that's documented clearly enough that someone else could use it to produce the same results you do. This includes your brand voice..." And so on. "Most business owners have zero of these documented. They have ideas, they have experience, they have skills, but none of it is captured in a format that scales."

This is not bad. Actually, this isn't bad. I might edit this. I might make some suggestions, but it is actually writing 80 to 90% of my brand voice. What's even better is that this Claude Code is connected to my Notion database. I can ask it to move it to my Notion database, or I can ask it to turn this into other pieces of content. I don't want to go over too much on this video because my next video will go over this, but let's just ask it. "Yes, I want you to save it to Notion email database and I want you to turn this into a quote post."

It could quickly do that, but let's see what it does. I have the skill. It went through the skill over here. Social media workflows. Create paragraph posts. Social media skill. It went through that and now it's going to save the email to Notion. That agent's doing that. I'm going to talk to our main agent now. "I want a paragraph post." Looks good. "Can you create it?" It is. Now it's using the Notion API. It's going to find the database and then it's going to create that email for us.

It just added it to Notion. Now, it's going to create the paragraph post carousel for us. You could see how it would look like. Yes. If I go to content, which is here, I have a content folder and I have one on quote posts. I go to digital assets. Click on yes. Now, I have a skill specifically for creating these posts. Now it's going to create slide one and slide two. For slide one I have a skill for creating visual content that looks aesthetic. Then slide two I have a skill for creating a typography quote slide. These are all skills that I've trained Claude Code. I created a skill. Some of these are micro skills or workflows that they could use to then get work done for me that I wouldn't need to do manually because if I were to do this manually it would take time.

Now it's creating this first slide. It's using Ideogram and then it's going to create the second slide. Doing this live is going to be interesting how this comes out. It took the prompt. It even created the prompt to send it here. Now it's creating the visual. It's using the API that I gave it access to. Man, this is crazy. Just me thinking about this, it would take me at least 30 minutes to get this done and this is getting done automatically. I could work on other stuff while the AI agents work.

This is how it looks like. This is slide one. "Your business lives in your head, that is why it can't scale." Again, slide one and then slide two. Let me zoom out here so you could read this. Actually doesn't look quite right, but we can always make edits to this. This is just an example of how Claude Code works. Slide one and then slide two. Obviously need to edit slide two. I could then ask it, "Can we decrease the font size for slide two to make it fit? Make the content, the text scale to fit, please."

That's just a quick walkthrough of how you could use how skills work in Claude Code. By the way, if you're wondering how you could potentially use skills in your business, I created a quick cheat sheet or a table that you could quickly reference to get some inspiration on what skills you could use, including content creation, repurposing, marketing and sales assets, client management, operations, business analytics, and reporting and automation and systematization. That's also included with the brand voice DNA extractor. If you want that, click the link in description and you'll get both the 50 examples of how you use Claude Skills plus the free brand voice DNA extractor.

The real powerful thing about skills is that it compounds. Think of it like a playbook chain. If you have an agent and you have multiple skills that you want it to do, it is able to do that within Claude Code. Let's say I have a skill A, which is I want it to help me create an output. Let's say this is an email. That's skill A. Skill B could be transforming it. I could turn this into a social post. And then skill C could be publishing it, like a skill on how to publish it. And then skill D could be going through your social media and then extracting the results on what happened to that specific post. Then this can create a feedback loop where you can have agents that run with skills that know how to do things just like how employees would work in your business.

This is super powerful because now you can have AI agents that are able to do actual work in your business, but the only thing that they depend on is having clear skills that you know how to teach them how to use.

Here are some other examples. Let's say you're a consultant, you have an intake form. You could turn that into a proposal that could be turned into onboarding emails, and then you can have reporting on how the onboarding went. Let's say you're an agency. You get a brief from a client that creates a deliverable, then it creates a review, then an invoice and so on. These skills can connect like daisy chains. You can have as many skills as you want. You can have them route between other skills. This becomes very, very powerful.

If you just think about it, if you are spending 30 minutes doing a specific task and you get a skill to do that within three minutes, that's going to save you 2.5 hours a week. And then that adds up to 10 hours a month. If we extend that to a year, that's 120 hours a year. And that is equivalent to three work weeks. Imagine just implementing one skill will save you three work weeks. And that one skill can compound to more. You can build more skills: one, two, three, four, five skills.

We're reaching a point in business where you can pretty much have AI agents do 80 to 90% of the work in your business. If you actually want that, subscribe to this channel and pay attention to my next videos because I'm going to be sharing more insights on how you could get AI agents and digital assets to do majority of the work for you in your business and scale in 2026. See you in the next video.
