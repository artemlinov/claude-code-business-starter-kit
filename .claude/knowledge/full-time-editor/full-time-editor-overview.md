# FULL-TIME EDITOR™ PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The 4-Month Mentorship for Skilled-But-Stuck Editors Ready to Scale to $5-10K/month

---

# Section 1: The Truth About Where You Are

## You're Not a Beginner

You know how to edit. You have clients. You're making *some* money.

But you're trapped in what feels like quicksand: the more you work, the more exhausted you get, and yet the income needle barely moves.

```
You look at editors charging $1K/video and think:

"I could do that... but I don't know what I'm missing."
```

You're tired of being the best-kept secret. You're tired of checking prices before buying things. You're tired of explaining to your parents that "yes, video editing is a real job."

And deep down, you're terrified that maybe you're not actually good enough.

## The "Skilled But Stuck" Reality

Here's what I know about you:

```
"I think that I don't have a problem, but I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem."

"For the past one year, I'm currently stuck on $1K per month. The highest I had was $1.8K."

"I know that my position could be so much more, but I'm lukewarm. My story is not evolving."
```

You're making $1-2K/month. Maybe $2-3K on a good month. Working 40-60 hours a week. Your effective hourly rate is probably $5-15/hour, but you try not to think about that.

You have 1-3 clients. Maybe one "main" client that makes you nervous because if they dropped you, you'd be at zero.

```
"$1.5K/month is a retainer, it's a good retainer. But if he drops me off, I'm at point zero. So I can be a bit comfortable, but I cannot be that comfortable."
```

## What You've Already Tried

You're not lazy. You've tried things:

* **Outreach:** "I was sending 300-400 emails per day. None of them really converted to good clients."
* **Posting on X:** "My posts were flopping hard. 100 impressions."
* **Courses:** "Every other course I've taken is not advanced enough. They take you from zero to a few grand a month. They can't help you get to $8-10K."

Nothing's working. And the worst part? You don't know why.

## The Real Problem

**What You Think The Problem Is:**

* "I need more clients"
* "I need to improve my editing"
* "I need to work harder"
* "I need better luck"

**What The ACTUAL Problem Is:**

* No positioning: you're a generalist in a specialist's game
* No storytelling fundamentals: compensating with effects (`Sparkle Syndrome™`)
* No confidence framework: can't justify premium prices
* No client acquisition system: hoping for inbound without a brand
* No accountability: procrastinating on growth while meeting client deadlines

You have the mechanical skills. You're missing the storytelling fundamentals that make videos *feel* right. And you're missing the systems to turn that skill into consistent $5-10K months.

# Section 2: The Transformation

## Where You Are Now

* $1-2K/month income
* 40-60 hour weeks
* Constant stress about money
* Living with parents or barely surviving
* Checking prices before buying anything
* Isolated, no editor community
* Imposter syndrome despite skills
* Taking any client that comes along
* Scared to raise prices
* One client dropping you = back to zero

```
"You know what it is to go to bed thinking about all this stuff, anxiety, waking up in the morning, the same thing."

"It feels like I'm chained to the desk every day."

"My watch in the Discord always sent things like, 'okay, today, high stress zone, two hours.' And everyone was making fun of me."
```

## Where You'll Be in 4 Months

* $5-10K/month income
* 4-6 hour focused workdays (`The 4-2-1™ Rule`)
* Financial independence
* Building savings and investments
* Part of thriving editor community
* Confident in pricing conversations
* Choosing clients, not chasing them
* 1-2 premium clients paying $1K+/video
* Recognized as creative partner, not vendor

```
"Now I'm getting inbounds that are paying €800 or €1K for a video." [Was $400 before]

"I'm charging him a fat €2,000 per vlog."

"I'm not as stressed anymore, which is actually a huge thing for me. Now I don't have the high stress zone anymore."

"What am I most proud of? I'm most proud of the safety."
```

## The Transformation You're Actually Buying

**Not just:** "$1K → $5K/month"

**Actually:** "Replaceable freelancer → Respected professional"

**Not just:** "More clients"

**Actually:** "Clients who value my work"

**Not just:** "Business tactics"

**Actually:** "The confidence to charge what I'm worth"

**Not just:** "Editing skills"

**Actually:** "Understanding that `Storytelling First™` is the differentiator"

# Section 3: The Program

## What Full-Time Editor Is

A 4-month mentorship program designed specifically for video editors scaling from $1-2K/month to $5-10K/month.

**Duration:** 4 months

**Investment:** $3,000

**For:** Video editors currently earning $1-2K/month who want to scale without burning out or starting an agency. Just getting better at what they already do.

**Prerequisites:** Must already know video editing basics (After Effects, Premiere Pro). This is NOT for beginners.

## The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: $1K Videos

Master `Storytelling First™`. The skill premium clients actually pay for.

```
"You just teach all these little things that are so minor, they're so small and simple, but they make all the fucking difference. As soon as you implement even one or two of those things, your edits just look so much better, so much more premium, so much more clean."
```

**What You'll Learn:**

* `Core Four™` – Pacing, Music, Visuals, Design
* `The Editing Hierarchy™` – Structure → Flow → Clarity → Polish
* `The VX™ Workflow` – Progressive cuts (V0, V1, V2)
* `Story Blocks™` – Sections for pacing
* `Powerful Phrases™` – Pacing through word emphasis
* `Story Proof™` – Real proof on screen
* `Base File™` – Reusable project assets

**How:** In-depth editing reviews of YOUR actual work. Frame-by-frame personalized feedback. Not generic modules you could find on YouTube.

### Pillar 2: Elite Brand

Position yourself as the obvious choice for premium clients.

**What You'll Learn:**

* Specialist positioning > generalist positioning
* How to stand out in a crowded market
* X/Twitter profile optimization
* Portfolio that makes you irresistible (3 great videos > 15 mediocre ones)
* Content strategy that attracts inbound opportunities
* `The Word-of-Work™ Method` – Using your work to attract clients

**The Result:** Premium work + premium positioning = premium creators reaching out to you.

### Pillar 3: Client Flow

Attract, close, and retain elite opportunities.

**ATTRACT:**

* Content strategy that pulls in the right opportunities
* `High-Ticket Outreach™` – Strategic, personalized outreach (not mass spam)
* Building genuine relationships in your niche

**CLOSE:**

* `Texts to Thousands™` – Conversations that convert via DM (no sales calls needed)
* Pricing with confidence (because you KNOW you're elite)
* Handling objections without desperation

**RETAIN:**

* Raising rates with existing relationships
* Building long-term partnerships
* Making yourself irreplaceable

# Section 4: What's Included

## 1\. Open One-on-One Access to Artem

Message me anytime. I make it a priority to get back to students within a few hours max.

If your question is more complicated, I'll record a personalized Loom helping you solve the issue. Not cookie-cutter answers. Always highly personalized and detailed.

If you have lots of questions or need to adjust direction, I'll propose a 1-on-1 call. You can request a call at any time.

```
"I've never had this kind of attitude to me. People were always just giving me these answers that are just for the general people who are editing, not especially for me."
```

## 2\. Weekly Editing Reviews

Submit your actual editing work. Get personalized Loom feedback. Frame-by-frame. Specific improvements to implement. Track your progress week-over-week.

Not generic feedback. YOUR specific gaps.

```
"The reviews of the videos really helped me. You saying how I'm always defaulting to a style. And then I made the next videos and those were viral Twitter videos. That was the biggest thing."
```

## 3\. Personalized Feedback on Everything

In-depth reviews on:

* Video edits
* Content
* Branding
* Client communication

This isn't a course where you watch videos and figure it out alone. This is mentorship. Direct feedback on YOUR work. Personalized guidance for YOUR situation.

## 4\. Full Curriculum (3 Pillars)

**Pillar 1: $1K Videos**

* Advanced storytelling editing techniques
* Workflow strategies to speed up editing without losing quality
* Become a top 1% editor

**Pillar 2: Elite Brand**

* Build a magnetic editing brand that attracts high-paying clients
* Become a specialist
* Tailor messaging to your dream client

**Pillar 3: Client Flow**

* Attract, close, and retain $1K/video clients
* Client acquisition strategies (inbound and outbound for high-ticket)
* Client communication and relationship-building
* Sales and closing techniques without sales calls

**Note:** The curriculum does NOT teach basic editing software skills. You need to know the basics already.

## 5\. Group Activities (4x Per Week)

**1x Weekly Masterclass**

I prepare a presentation on a topic. You learn from it, get questions answered, walk away with actionable insights.

**1x Weekly Review**

Going over participants' weeks and giving action items for the following week.

**2x Weekly Group Coaching Calls**

Extra touchpoints. Join the call and get any of your questions answered.

```
"The main thing inside the program for me was the group calls. Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video. Having those group calls quite a few times a week with the boys inside the program: they're all legends. It gets you in a good mood again and lights the fire back in you."
```

## 6\. Community Access

Access to an engaged community of video editors who are either:

* Already earning $5-10K/month
* Working toward the $5-10K/month goal

Potential client referrals. Connections with editors at your level.

```
"The guys in the community are so nice. The group calls literally made my day."

"Being with the community who is already earning $5K to $10K: it will be more motivating for me."
```

## 7\. Accountability Systems

You submit a weekly and monthly form outlining your week/month. I personally go through every submission to make sure you're on track.

If you're inactive, I WILL reach out to prevent you from falling into ruts.

```
"When I need to get a video done, I instantly sat down the next day at 6am and started editing and wanted to finish as fast as I can so I can please my client. But when it actually comes down to helping myself with outreaching, I just procrastinated on it for days."
```

You'll meet any client deadline. But you procrastinate on your own growth. That's why accountability matters. I make sure you actually do the things that move the needle.

---

# Section 5: Why This Works

## The Problem With Other Programs

```
"Every other course I've taken is not advanced enough. They mostly take you from zero to a few grand a month. They can't really help you get to 8K-10K per month."

"It just says, yeah, post on Twitter. But I've been doing that for years now."

"It wasn't a personal connection. It was paying to have YouTube free videos inside a paid community."
```

Other programs fail you because:

* They're for beginners (you're not a beginner)
* They're generic (you need personalized feedback)
* They're passive (you need accountability)
* They're not niche-specific (you need advice for YOUR type of editing)

## What Makes Full-Time Editor Different

### 1\. Advanced, Not Beginner

Other programs take you from 0 → $2K. Full-Time Editor takes you from $1-2K → $5-10K. Different problem, different solution.

### 2\. Niche-Specific

```
"Your courses are directly made on business and talking head videos, which is perfect. You learn so much from someone who is directly in your niche."
```

### 3\. Personalized Accountability

Not generic course content. Actual feedback on your edits, your outreach, your situation.

### 4\. Still In The Arena

I'm not a retired guru. I recently lived this exact journey. I still edit for premium clients. I know what works NOW.

### 5\. Community of Similar Editors

Not a Discord with 10,000 randoms. A tight community of editors at similar stages.

### 6\. Diagnostic, Not Generic

I find what's missing for YOU specifically. Create YOUR custom roadmap to $5-10K/month. Not cookie-cutter modules.

# Section 6: Real Results

## Taylor (UK): From Warehouse Freezer to $4K/month Client

**Before:**

```
"I worked in a warehouse in the freezer, literal minus 27 degrees. I was working in the freezer with food every single day."

"It was a bit discouraging. I felt like I was just hitting my head on a brick wall. You're doing outreach, posting bangers that are doing well on Twitter and nothing's coming from it."

"I kind of got to the point where it was like, okay, I'm gonna get rich or die trying. Because I'm not doing this for the rest of my fucking life."
```

**After:**

```
"I posted a re-edit on Twitter. End of the day, it was 140 likes. I was getting a ton of inbounds."

"The 1st of January, new year, first day of the new year, I got a DM from Stan. A YouTuber with 11 million subscribers."

"It was $1K a week. So basically a $4K a month job."

"A guy on YouTube with 11 million subscribers has reached out to me because he likes my work. That's crazy to me. That's fucking insane."
```

## Kimi (Germany, 17): $400/video → €2,000/video

**Before:**

```
"I didn't really know how to get clients. I had clients mainly mostly because of just luck."

"Before, like January, December, November, I was always really stressed because I knew that the clients could always just stop working with me. I was incredibly stressed."

"My watch in the Discord always sent things like, 'okay, today, high stress zone, two hours.'"
```

**After:**

```
"I'm charging him a fat €2,000 per vlog."

"Now I'm getting inbounds that are paying €800 or €1K for a video."

"I'm not as stressed anymore, which is actually a huge thing for me. Now I don't have the high stress zone anymore."

"What am I most proud of? I'm most proud of the safety."
```

## The Pattern

The students who succeed share something: they show up, submit work, and implement feedback.

```
"Just like overall with editing, definitely joining the mentorship. 100%, because that was literally like, everything changed from there. I don't know where I'd be now if I hadn't joined."
```

# Section 7: Is This For You?

## This IS For You If:

* You're making $1-2K/month editing (you have baseline skill)
* You know After Effects and Premiere (you're not a beginner)
* You've been stuck at the same income for 6+ months
* You're a quality-over-quantity person
* You want to work LESS while earning MORE
* You're willing to submit work and hear honest feedback
* You care about craft, not just cash
* You're ready to invest in yourself

**Specific indicators:**

* You watch top 1% editors and think "I could do that... but I don't know what I'm missing"
* You're frustrated because you work hard but income isn't growing
* You have imposter syndrome despite getting paid
* You want work-life balance (fitness, friends, travel matter to you)
* You're ready to hear honest feedback even when uncomfortable

## This Is NOT For You If:

* You're a complete beginner who doesn't know editing software
* You've never gotten paid to edit
* You want to scale to 50 videos/month (agency model)
* You're looking for "easy money" or overnight results
* You want to watch videos and "figure it out" alone
* You won't submit work for review
* You think you don't need to improve

# Section 8: The Investment

## The Numbers

**Investment:** $3,000

**Duration:** 4 months

**Monthly:** $750/month

## The ROI Math

You're currently at $1-2K/month.

If you hit $5K/month after the program, that's $3K extra per month.

The entire investment pays for itself in ONE month of the difference.

And then you keep making $5-10K/month. Month after month.

```
$5K/month = $1,250/week

$5K/month = 5 videos at $1K

$5K/month = 1 premium client, not 5 low-paying ones
```

## The Real Cost of NOT Investing

```
"What happens if we literally have the same exact conversation half a year later and you're in the same position?"
```

You've been stuck for how long? 6 months? A year? 2 years?

What's another year of $1-2K/month costing you?

* The apartment you can't afford
* The trip you can't take
* The stress you can't escape
* The family pressure that won't stop
* The imposter syndrome that keeps growing

The question isn't whether you can afford the program.

The question is whether you can afford to stay stuck.

# Section 9: How It Works

## Step 1: Apply

Fill out the application. Tell me about your current situation, your goals, and why you want to join.

## Step 3: Onboarding

If we're a fit, you'll get:

* Access to the curriculum
* Access to the community
* Your personalized roadmap call with me

## Step 4: The Work Begins

You'll start submitting edits, getting feedback, attending calls, and implementing. The transformation happens through action, not just consumption.

---

# Section 10: The Commitment

## What I Promise

* **Honest Assessment:** I'll show you exactly what you're missing, using YOUR actual work
* **Personalized Roadmap:** Custom plan for YOUR situation
* **Hands-On Support:** Weekly reviews, open access, group sessions
* **Craft Mastery:** I'll help you become a top 1% editor
* **No Bullshit:** I'll tell you what you need to hear, delivered with empathy

## What I Don't Promise

* "Easy money" or "get rich quick"
* Results without work
* Overnight transformation
* Magic formulas

## The Only Guarantee

If you show up to calls, submit your work for review, and implement the feedback, you'll improve. Your editing will get better. Your income will grow.

The program doesn't fail.

But if you join and ghost, nothing happens.

```
The question isn't "Will this work?"

The question is "Will you work it?"
```

---

# Section 11: Final Word

## The Gap Is Smaller Than You Think

You're closer than you realize.

The gap between $200/video and $1K/video isn't massive. It's not 5 years of experience. It's not film school. It's not expensive gear.

It's mastering the `Core Four™` and positioning yourself to attract premium clients.

## You Don't Have to Figure It Out Alone

```
"Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video."
```

You've been trying to figure this out on your own. It's not working.

The editors who break through don't do it alone. They get feedback. They get accountability. They get community.

## The Core Message

You're not a beginner anymore. You know how to edit. You have clients.

But you're stuck, and you can feel it.

The gap between where you are and $5-10K/month isn't as big as you think.

It's not about working harder.

It's about working differently.

And you don't have to figure it out alone.

```
Storytelling First™. Always.

Top 1% Editing. Full-Time Income. Freedom Lifestyle.
```
