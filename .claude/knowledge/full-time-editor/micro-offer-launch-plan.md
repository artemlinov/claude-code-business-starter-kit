## **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Primary Goal:**
- 15 spots filled = $7,485 revenue

**Stretch Goal:**
- 20 spots filled (if demand warrants expansion) = $9,980 revenue

**Upsell Goal (Week 2-4 of delivery):**
- 50% upsell rate to main $3K program
- 15 customers × 50% = 7-8 upsells = $21K-24K additional revenue

**Total Potential Revenue:**
- Micro offer sales: $7,485-9,980
- Upsells to main program: $21K-24K
- **Combined: $28K-34K from this single launch**

---

## **FOUNDER OS TIMING CONTEXT**

- Reference Founder OS webinar launch resources for email sequence timing and cadence
- Adapt their webinar model to this micro offer launch (same urgency principles)
- Don't overlap Skool posts with main email sends (space by 1-2 days)

---

## **STRATEGIC NOTES**

**Why 15 spots vs 20:**
- Real scarcity > fake scarcity
- 15 thirty-minute onboarding calls = 7.5 hours (manageable)
- Can always expand "due to demand" if momentum is strong
- Easier to fill 15 and turn people away (creates urgency for next launch)

**Why Feb 14 launch:**
- 3.5 weeks prep time (plenty of runway)
- Skool funnel is warm NOW (YouTube video momentum)
- Valentine's Day angle: "Invest in yourself" messaging
- Avoids Claude Code cohort distraction (postponed to March)

**Why NOT doing Claude Code cohort yet:**
- Micro offer launch is time-sensitive (YouTube momentum, warm Skool funnel)
- Can't split focus during critical launch window (Feb 3-15)
- Cohort will run again in March/April with more breathing room
- Revenue from this launch funds future skill investments

---

## **WHAT NOT TO DO**

- Don't create separate onboarding calls for micro vs main program (use same group calls)
- Don't send Skool posts on same day as main email blasts (space them out)
- Don't over-automate before testing (V1 manual processes, iterate later)
- Don't fill all 15 spots with low-quality leads (maintain standards, turn people away if needed)
- Don't start working on Newsletter project until after launch (focus on Copywriter project only)

---

## **NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Jan 20-21)**

1. Create FTE Copywriter Claude project
2. Draft Gamma checkout doc for micro offer
3. Set up Stripe payment link
4. Test end-to-end checkout flow
5. Test DM flow with next 3-5 Skool inbounds

**By Jan 26:**
- Gamma doc live and tested
- Skool onboarding section updated
- All software integrations working
- Email sequences drafted and scheduled
- Content pre-batched for launch week
