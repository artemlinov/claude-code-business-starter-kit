# FTE™ VOICE OF CUSTOMER

*The Complete Psychology of the Skilled-But-Stuck Video Editor*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Voice of Customer document captures the exact language, emotional drivers, pain points, desires, and decision-making psychology of video editors who are considering Full-Time Editor. All quotes and insights are extracted directly from sales call transcripts, coaching calls, and success interviews between Artem and video editor prospects/students.

### Key Findings:

* Prospects consistently describe feeling **"stuck"** despite working full-time hours
* Fear of raising rates and losing clients is the #1 psychological barrier
* Most have tried outreach, posting on X, or other programs with little success
* Family dynamics (living with parents, proving freelancing is legitimate) play a significant role
* Income inconsistency and lack of a clear roadmap create persistent anxiety
* Investment hesitation stems from never having invested in themselves before
* They can meet client deadlines consistently but procrastinate on their own growth
* Financial anxiety has measurable physical effects (stress tracking, sleep deprivation)
* The loneliness of editing makes community more valuable than expected
* Other courses/programs don't take them beyond $2-4K/month

**The central discovery:** Money is never the real goal. It's a proxy for identity transformation. They want to become someone who deserves respect: from clients, family, and most importantly, from themselves.

---

## THE CORE TRUTH

Your prospect is NOT a beginner. They know how to edit. They have clients. They're making *some* money. But they're trapped in what feels like quicksand: the more they work, the more exhausted they get, and yet the income needle barely moves.

They look at other editors charging $1K+ per video and think: **"I could do that... but I don't know what I'm missing."**

They're tired of being the best-kept secret. They're tired of checking prices before buying things. They're tired of explaining to their parents that "yes, video editing is a real job." And deep down, they're terrified that maybe, just maybe, they're not actually good enough.

---

## PART 1: WHO THEY ARE

### A. The "Quality Over Quantity" Identity

**Botond (Hungary, 18):**

```
"I'm more of a quality over quantity guy. Yeah, definitely."

"I'm making $1.2K per month in Hungary. That's what people make at 40 years old on their jobs."

"I was pretty scared because I've actually never edited a documentary video in my life. But I just told him $300 per video seems fine. And at the time that was mind blowing for me. Someone is paying me $300 for one video. It was just amazing to me."

"I got sick while editing one of these videos. I had a fever, a very bad one, and he wanted the video the next day but the renders didn't finish on time. So I actually woke up at 2am just because that's when the render finished, just to ship the video to him."
```

**Dinal (Sri Lanka/UK):**

```
"I kind of fell into the trap when I came back into editing of just doing poor quality and just doing quantity. It just ruins your mindset because you just want to cut corners and get the video done fast and not really care about the client."

"I want to focus on quality because I want to be a better editor too. Not just making a lot of money."

"My dream scenario is working with clients that actually make you improve your editing. High paying clients that have good, high expectations for your editing and want you to improve."
```

**Kris (Bulgaria):**

```
"Even if I have two clients that pay me $2K a video, I need to be putting my soul into the video to be worth it. If someone is paying me $2K, I need to be solely on that video, focusing on doing the best I can so they get the best results."

"My goal is $5K/month for now, realistically. I think I will be able to hit that."
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I feel like I don't have a clear defined style on the editing, and my work seems pretty inconsistent. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's really trash."

"I think that I don't have a problem, but I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem."
```

---

### B. The Income Ceiling They Can't Break

**Tiago (Portugal):**

```
"I dropped out of uni like one year ago completely."

"$1.5K/month is a retainer, it's a good retainer. But if he drops me off, I'm at point zero. So I can be a bit comfortable, but I cannot be that comfortable. I need to have more safety."

"My parents make together a bit more than $2K a month. And that's okay to live, but they are not comfortable."
```

**Sam (India):**

```
"For the past one year, I'm currently stuck on $1K per month. The highest I had was $1.8K. And for the past one to two months it's even below $1K. Not good, man."

"I want to improve. I want to escape that loop. I'm stuck at $1K for the past year."
```

**Brian (USA, balancing day job):**

```
"I'm making... I think $3K/month was the highest I ever had in editing. But that was from me editing every day. And that's when I burned out from also balancing work."

"I definitely do think I want to quit the 9-5 when I save a little bit more from the job."
```

**Kimi (Germany, 17):**

```
"I'm still kind of a $2K to $3K a month person. It kind of sucks."

"I didn't really know how to get clients. I had clients mainly mostly because of just luck. I was kind of holding on to that. But I didn't really know how to actually get clients myself from scratch."
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"It's been up and down. At the start of the year it was around $1.8K, $1.7K for a couple months. Then it dropped a bit. Now it's up again. So half a year maybe."

"I know that if I stay consistent, I can make more money. But I haven't raised the prices."
```

---

### C. The Countries They Come From (Money Mindset Context)

**Marti (Bulgaria, 16 years old):**

```
"I'm from Bulgaria. The salary is not very high. People really think that $3K per month is a lot. You can actually live very good with $3K per month in Bulgaria."

"I was thinking that the top editors are getting $500 bucks max per video. And Artem was like, 'No, I charge $2,500 per video.' And I was like, 'What?' That changed my whole mindset."
```

**Omar (asking parents for money):**

```
"I could ask, but it's a bit... I'm not a person who actually wants to ask money from my parents. It's uncomfortable for me."
```

**Meet (India):**

```
"It's still like one month of my salary, so... Yeah, I think I should give some time to think."

"He won't understand the online business space very much, but still it's a big investment for me."
```

**Fati:**

```
"I'm in a comfort zone. I have a few hundred dollars in my bank and if I compare to the people around me, that's a lot. When I see myself from their eyes, okay, I'm in a good position. But also I can't buy expensive things like a MacBook. So it's not so high that I can directly change my life, but also not so low that I would have fire in my ass."
```

---

## PART 2: CURRENT STATE (Pain & Frustration)

### A. Surface-Level Pains

#### **Income Frustration** [FREQUENCY: Mentioned in nearly every call]

```
"I'm charging the same from when I started. My editing was pretty bad then. But now it's pretty good. So why am I charging the same?" - Ezequiel

"I see the rates going down, man. I remember two years ago it was so easy to find clients for good rates and now there are just so many people from Arabic countries, from India, they just plummeted the rates down. The VSLs that clients were eager to pay me $5K two years ago. Now they want to pay $1K." - Danyil

"Basically per hour they were paying me 17 Canadian dollars. And then I asked for a fair rate, at least 30 Canadian dollars. But they said no. They basically raised it to 23 Canadian dollars." - André

"Whatever I earn just goes straight into household expenses, like buying food, groceries."

"Imagine that I was surviving on $150 for almost a year now." - Lucca

"I average at least 50 hours per week and sometimes have to edit on the weekends."
```

#### **Feeling Stuck & Lack of Urgency** [FREQUENCY: Very High]

```
"To be honest, I felt quite stuck working with him. My income was very inconsistent at the time." - Botond

"I really felt like because I didn't outreach, I didn't get any inbound leads and it honestly felt pretty bad." - Botond

"I felt pretty bad about it because I told myself before that I was going to lock in and get all these new clients after school, but it just didn't work out." - Botond

"I know that my position could be so much more, but I'm lukewarm. I have the story, the movie plot, the anime plot where everything goes crazy and the character development is crazy. And I'm feeling like I'm in the period where I have the opportunities to train, to fight, to meet new people and go to the next arc and I'm just like... I'm tired. Let's just keep it. My story is not evolving." - Tom

"Three hours ago, I was watching a video I searched up on YouTube: 'How do I have a sense of urgency?' Yeah, I'm concerned about this thing that I need a sense of urgency." - Fati

"I hate my current place, but not as much as I would have fire. If I had cancer or something, I would probably be like, 'Oh, I need $10K for my treatment. I have to make it.'" - Fati

"I've been editing since March and I've just kind of stayed at a stale income between $600 to $900, depending on the consistency of my clients." - Taylor
```

**Taylor (The Discouraging Period):**

```
"It was a bit discouraging because I felt like I was just hitting my head on a brick wall. You're trying, you're doing outreach, you're posting bangers that are doing well on Twitter, and nothing's coming from it."

"Even if there were inbound leads, I upped my standards. Obviously I'm not going to be taking $100, $200, even $300 jobs. It's just way too low pay. So it was just getting discouraging after constant trying."

"Everything needed to change. Everything."
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I've been stuck at this stage for six months at this point."

"I haven't increased prices. Not a lot. Even the fitness podcast client is new, so we've been working on four podcasts. She's the biggest client I have and I don't want to increase on her since the work is really good. And the other podcast dude, I haven't increased either. I think for six months I haven't increased. But I'm scared I might lose him or something like that."
```

#### **Client Acquisition Struggles** [FREQUENCY: High]

```
"I was getting ghosted by almost 90% of the people I outreached." - Planet

"The only thing I tried was posting on X but my posts were flopping hard, getting 100 impressions." - Botond

"When I tried outreaching they ghosted me and I just got discouraged and I felt like I didn't even know what I was doing." - Botond

"I have tried sending re-edits but most of them I just got ghosted on. They did well on X, I guess that's great. But the actual client itself didn't... I don't think they even checked the emails." - Botond

"I've been getting no response for my outreach, but it is normal. I got used to not getting responses for outreach mails or DMs." - Carlos

"I tried outreach. I was sending 300 to 400 emails per day. None of them really converted to good clients." - Ziscol
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I get quite a lot of inbounds and when I outreach, I guess some. But I don't sign most of them because they're either not the style that I'm looking for or they don't like my rate."

"So the issue is that you're getting the clients but not the high paying clients." - [Artem summarizing]

"Yeah." - David
```

---

### B. Deeper Pains (What They Reveal as Conversation Progresses)

#### Anxiety & Emotional Weight

```
"I have this anxiety. This client is very special for me because he's my brother in law. If he drops me, I don't have anyone. And I get really nervous. I don't know why I get really nervous. I think this stuff came back from school, some school trauma that I had." - Alejo

"I'm desperate. My situation right now... you know what it is to go to bed and thinking about all this stuff, all of it, anxiety, waking up in the morning, the same thing. It's fucking routine. And then I go out with friends and have some drinks. It's kind of a fucked up story. I try to forget about my actual situation and then come home. I don't want to be in that path." - Alejo

"Sometimes it's hard for me because I spend all these hours editing a video, and the video doesn't perform well. I have this voice sabotaging myself and it's fucked up sometimes." - Alejo

"The worst case is that the guy doesn't like the video, I make a refund and that's it. But when I start to think, 'Oh no, he's gonna tell about me being a bad editor to all his followers, and nobody's gonna hire me.' I start to put all these worst case scenarios that aren't gonna happen and it's kind of messing me up in the process." - Alejo

"It feels like I'm stuck to the desk. Like I'm chained to the desk every day. I'm working all these hours but I don't see any... I don't reap the rewards from being at the desk that much. That's why it just feels like torture sometimes." - KP

"I don't feel like editing, get burnt up very easily. If I'm doing all nighters with some other clients, it just doesn't feel rewarding." - KP

"That's why I started Twitter. Because what if I get dropped? Then I have no income source." - Kanishk
```

**Andre (Portugal):**

```
"My mental state comes and goes."

"Right now I basically have one consistent client and that's it. And it's very scary, always thinking about next month."

"This last year I made quite a lot less money than the previous year. I made €10K less from one year to the other and it's quite depressing."

"Last year, there was a month I made €100. It was absolutely awful. Last year was a piece of shit. I hated last year."

"I had a girlfriend for two years that I really committed to the relationship and I just had to break up with her in June and I'm still struggling with it. We had plans and stuff like that, but she didn't reciprocate what I gave her."

"I also lost my grandfather last year. So it was a piece of shit year. This year has to be better. This has to be the year."
```

**Kimi (Germany) - The Stress Before:**

```
"Before, like January, December, November, I was always really stressed because I knew that the clients could always just stop working with me. And I didn't really have any backup and I didn't really get any inbounds. So I was incredibly stressed. Really stressed."

"My watch in the Discord always sent things like, 'okay, today, high stress zone, two hours.' And everyone was making fun of me."
```

#### The "No Normal Job" Identity Crisis

```
"The problem is that I don't have a normal job and I know I can go further than that." - Ryan

"I don't want to get another traditional job. I don't want to get that." - Jonathan

"When you start out with any business, people are not gonna respect you for it, because they can't see any results." - Botond

"When I was working at a 9 to 5 and not doing anything creative, I would just come home from work and I'd just be so tired and not applying myself. I felt way more tired, way more stressed. The second that I got into video editing, I could feel myself just growing in a certain way." - Joseph
```

**Taylor (The 9-5 Escape):**

```
"I've always just hated authority. Not police, but in terms of back in school I was always like, I hated school. I did not like it. I hated listening to teachers tell me what to do."

"I don't want to be stuck in one place. The whole story of a 9-5 job. You can't travel wherever you want, you can't live wherever you want, you're very handicapped by how much you earn. Even if you do earn a lot of money, you can't really spend it. And if you want to go on holiday, you have to ask, 'Can I go on holiday please?' Like yeah, you can get a week off max. I'm not doing that."

"I absolutely do not give a fuck about a very high paying job that's $100K a year. I don't care if it's shit."

"I kind of set my mind to the fact that I'm never going to work a job again. I'm not going back to that. And if I do, then it's only going to be temporary."

"I kind of got to the point where it was like, okay, I'm gonna get rich or die trying at this point. Because I was like, I'm not doing this for the rest of my fucking life."

"I'm only 24, I'm still young as fuck. But it felt like yesterday when I was 18, and I'm still in the same position as I was then. So I just took a reality check and I was like, I need to sort my shit out."
```

#### Undervalued & Underappreciated

**Taylor:**

```
"I enjoy it when I've got the right clients though, because I've had an experience with actually two clients where they've just been toxic as hell."

"One actually scammed me. Luckily I got half payment up front, but I did the video for him and sent it to him, and then just never heard anything back. So obviously I missed half the payment on that."

"My first client... he was just a twat. He treated me like, never praised me for any of my work. Even though he'd send all these revisions and I'd always be on the ball, responding, always hitting deadlines. But yeah, it was just toxic."

"I worked six years of shitty warehouse jobs before this, and I'm not going to accept that anymore."

"Nowadays this is straight up non-negotiable. I don't care what the pay is. If the client is a dickhead and I hate working for him every single day, I don't care, I'm not gonna work for him. Even if the pay's twice, three times as much as a client who is respectful, praises your work if you do a good job. I will pick the good client all day long."

"When you have a client who is disrespectful, they kind of treat you like they're your boss. And I hate that."

"I'm not creative if I hate what I'm doing. If I hate the work I'm doing, I can't sit down and just do a really good job because, truthfully, I don't really want to. If I'm going to do my best work, I want to do it for a client that I want to do that work for."
```

**Antonello:**

```
"Sometimes he doesn't want to spend too much money. So increasing the prices from $25 per minute to a fixed rate was already a sort of nightmare."

"A lot of people told me that when I tell them the prices I charge and how much I make, people are quite shocked because they think I can make more. And I kinda agree. But there's still something I'm missing if I'm not there."
```

---

#### The Procrastination Trap

**Nikos (The Procrastinator's Confession):**

```
"I procrastinate a lot on starting on a video, and then I end up having too little time to work for it. It's still enough and I manage to get it done, but I think I waste a lot of time in between."

"I have tried sometimes and I get some work done for the video, but then I stop because I feel like I don't need to get it done because I have three or four more days."

"In these three to four days, I don't do much. That's a problem because I end up wasting a lot of time. I may do some outreach, but that's about it."

"I could definitely make it a lot better if I start from the first day."
```

**Sam:**

```
"I was procrastinating. My drive has gone low. My motivation is low. I was basically wasting time."

"I'm telling you... I was consuming brain rot content."
```

**Tiago:**

```
"This week I have one crazy video to do and the other week I have one motion graphic and that's it. And having those hours to fill with work that I don't know what type of work I should do is what's making me slow down, making me just procrastinate."
```

**Botond (The Accountability Paradox):** [From Success Interview]

```
"When I need to get a video done, I instantly sat down the next day at 6am and started editing and wanted to finish as fast as I can so I can please my client the best. But when it actually comes down to helping myself with outreaching, for example, then I just didn't really do it. I don't know, I just procrastinated on it for days."

"I'm just the kind of person who when has to do things for himself, I usually procrastinate on. When there's someone holding my hand or someone I have to do things for, then I'm much more likely to work harder. It's about accountability."

"So definitely having someone who keeps me accountable on my actions and hypes me up when I fail is definitely another big thing for me."
```

**Analysis:** This is the core paradox. Editors will NEVER miss a client deadline: they'll wake up at 2am with a fever to ship a video. But they'll procrastinate indefinitely on their own growth because there's no external accountability. The comfort zone trap isn't laziness: it's the absence of external deadlines for needle-moving activities.

---

#### Lack Of Direction & Clarity

```
"I'm just a bit at a plateau. I don't know what to do from here. I'm a bit directionless." - Taylor

"I think I'm lost. That's why I'm on this call right now. I mean I can make money through editing, but I just need a way, a roadmap to get to that point." - Meet

"I would say I'm looking for guidance or a roadmap of a sort." - Lindsey

"In between all the information, I was kind of burned out also at the time. So with all the information and with the burnout, I didn't follow any path since early." - Alejandro

"I think the first two things you said: maybe a direction and being a little confused about it." - Joseph [when asked what's holding him back]

"I didn't really know what I was doing. And I didn't really know how to get new clients exactly." - Botond [describing his experience before FTE]

"I needed a clear roadmap from someone: what to actually do that actually worked for other people." - Botond
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"To be honest, I'm not sure. I guess the problem is that I think that I don't have a problem, but I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem."
```

---

#### Family Pressure & Proving Themselves

```
"My dad thinks that I'm wasting my time and I should go and help him. He thinks that I need to go to the army so I'm more disciplined." - Alejo

"The colleges here are not very good. The degrees I will get from colleges around here will not be of any use. Literally not of any use." - Ansh

"The biggest boundary was actually making my parents and my friends understand that I actually am doing something important and that they shouldn't bother me. Because when I started out, when you start out with any business, people are not gonna respect you for it because they can't see any results." - Botond

"Basically all day I was playing video games. So when I started editing they kind of thought that I was doing the same. But when you make them understand that you are actually doing something important to build your future, then it's where they start to take you seriously." - Botond

"It's peer pressure, family stuff. I'm going to economics class. It's the easiest one there. So it's just to show family that I go to university and that's it." - Belo

"I'd have to move back home first of all. That's the main thing because I'm not making enough to sustain living out here." - Taylor [if editing doesn't work out]

"It's distracting sometimes. They ask me to, they talk to me when I'm working. They are watching when I'm working. That's also distracting." - Aditya

"It's just holding me back in terms of becoming an actual man." - Meet
```

**Joseph:**

```
"All the jobs that I've worked in past I got in from a relative or a friend. And so video editing, although I did get in because of my cousin, I think how far I take it is all on me. So it's a little bit of a pride thing: seeing if I could really take it to $100K a year. It's like I built something and that's a good feeling on its own."

"It's not even proving your family wrong, but just proving yourself that you are self dependent." - [Artem summarizing]

"Exactly. Yes." - Joseph
```

---

#### The Emotional Collapse (Burnout)

**Dinal's Story:**

```
"I was working for a family channel with 11 million subscribers for six months. And I was constantly working 12 hours a day, just working, working, working."

"After that I felt like I just can't get out of bed. I'm just really empty and depressed. I'm not really feeling myself."

"I needed a protocol where I just had to absolutely just be an idiot for a month and just take an actual break. So I decided to completely stop working and just indulge myself with as much dopamine."

"It was just from overworking and not putting any value to my personal life. It was just solely work."
```

**Brian's Sleep Deprivation:**

```
"For this month, at least for September, I tracked my sleep. And I found out that I've only had two or three days where I actually hit seven hours. Everything else is less and it's averaging around four to five hours."

"That's because after work I edit and then I usually stay up at night to finish out some videos. So it's been impacting my sleep and then also impacting my social life too. Just because the weekends are also time where I used to edit. It's been taking a toll on a lot of aspects of my life."
```

**Danyil's Breakdown:**

```
"I had a burnout around three years ago, two and a half. It took me six months to recover from the burnout."

"First it was $7K month and then it was $10.5K, it was so much work. And then on top of that I had to change countries and on top of that there was some personal issues and just the amount of stress."

"At some point, when I finished the projects, I was just crushed. Couldn't get up from bed for a week."
```

## PART 3: DESIRED STATE (Dreams & Aspirations)

### A. Immediate Desires

#### **Financial Goals** [FREQUENCY: Every call]

```
"The goal is 3 to 5 clients. $5K per month." - Lindsey

"I want to be that guy who makes 2 to 3 clients and making $10K per month or $5K per month. Volume is not the way I want to go. It's not optimized." - Tayyab

"I have goals, dreams I want to achieve. Being stuck at one case is not an option for me." - Lucca

"What I want to get to is ideally £2K within the next couple of months. I know that's quite ambitious." - Taylor

"I want more. $1.5K here in Portugal is what many guys are doing for the first years after graduating. But yeah, I want more." - Tiago

"Firstly, $3-4K is actually enough to move out, but to travel the world it's $8-10K, maybe $6K or $7K plus." - Tiago

"I feel like $3K a month would be a good start and then I could just work from there because $3K was the highest I ever had in editing." - Brian

"I want to be able to make at least $3,000 a month, every month, just have that as a stable income and still have the same free time." - HamoZ

"Achieving the $3K per month goal doing long form." - Meet

"My goal is to really scale past $1K to $5K/month." - Kanishk
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"Our goal now is to get to $5K per month editing."

"$3K." - [Artem correcting]

"Okay, $3K."
```

**Joseph:**

```
"My girlfriend is studying to become a vet. She told me she wants to really commit herself to vet school and she'd prefer not to be working during that time because it'll relieve a lot of stress. So I want to make enough for both of us to be able to live on our own and she could fully commit herself to vet school."

"I think I want to make somewhere between $7K to $10K a month. I know that's kind of a high number, but I feel like if I really try, I could reach that goal."

"I saw that one of the other video editors with the last client I was working with, he has a Twitter and he was saying he was making around $100K a year. And that sounds pretty good to me."
```

#### **Quality Over Quantity** [FREQUENT THEME]

```
"My biggest problem is management, time management. It'd be so much easier just to have five clients. Even if it takes longer to make the videos, that's still way more manageable than 15 different people and having to keep up with them every day." - Lindsey

"I want to focus on quality because I want to be a better editor too. Not just making a lot of money." - Dinal

"My dream scenario is working with clients that actually make you improve your editing. High paying clients that have good, high expectations." - Dinal
```

#### The $1K Per Video Dream

```
"$1K for videos is already insane." - Kris

"Having the leverage to choose this client over that client would be the reason that I would be able to charge $1K per video or even more." - Ansh
```

**Marti (After Success with FTE):**

```
"One guy messaged me, and he was like, 'How much are you charging?' And I saw he's kind of big, he's making money from his program. So I was like, 'I charge $1K per video.' Because I was just sick of people just messaging me, offering me $200 and $300. And he was like, 'Yeah, that works.' He gave me the video. He paid me 50% upfront. I made the video. He paid me 50% after. And I was like, 'What the fuck did I just do?'"

### B. Deeper Desires (The Emotional Core)

#### Freedom From Financial Stress

```
"So that you don't worry about money that much. I want to be able to help my friends, do what I want, and just do what I love." - Ryan

"I just want to cover my costs with a bit left over, like £2K per month." - Taylor

"It's not really I can't buy some things but... I can't go out every night or if I want to have people over, I gotta save up for that stuff in advance." - Ryan

"My goal has always just been to do what I love and be able to live off of it and not have to ever really worry about money. If my girlfriend ever needs anything, I could just get it, not worry about it." - Ryan

"I would be pretty chill. I have the money. I don't have to worry about the money of buying essential things. I can book a flight to anywhere." - Ezequiel

"I want to have that amount of money to be independent and financially free." - Dmitry

"The worst part about what I do is that I don't feel that I have the financial freedom to just... I want to travel, I want to go there, I want to buy this, I want to buy that. And I just can't without any worries." - André

"I have all this weight on my shoulders right now. If I hit that amount of money, I would be more relaxed, less anxiety and life would be better." - Alejo

"I never know what will happen next month." - André
```

#### The Real Dream: Freedom

**Taylor's Escape:**

```
"I'm from the UK, but mate, I don't want to go back home. And that's the plan. I don't want to go back home."

"Since I've been out here in Thailand, I just... this is how I want to live. This is where I want to stay: Asia, Thailand, Bali, those kind of places. Because it's just such a better quality of life."

"My job was I was stuck in a warehouse working in a freezer, minus 27 degrees every day. And I was like, damn bro, people are making money online and living in Thailand and living a good life. I need to sort my shit out."
```

**Tiago's Vision:**

```
"It sucks a lot to live in a split bedroom with my brother."

"I really want to give my girlfriend a trip to Madeira. She really wants to go to Madeira. She's spamming me every single week with tiktoks and reels about Madeira."

"Right now I could give, but I'm not comfortable enough to do that. It sucks because I really want to give my loved ones the things that they want."

"Being stuck, I could live comfortably myself, but I could not give to the ones I love."
```

**Brian's Dream:**

```
"I've been getting this feeling of wanting to quit the 9-5 even more in my heart."

"I feel like this is just the best time for me to pursue something and try it out instead of going to the future and living a life of regret not knowing what could have been."

"I feel like I would still always try to be a video editor. It's just that I'll probably be stuck in that loop where I'm editing for the low end clients and not being able to make it an actual career. So it's always going to be that dream of becoming one but can't, just being in a cycle of that."
```

**Marti (After Success with FTE):**

```
"My future plan is right now to just keep working with my current clients because they're my dream clients. They're paying me very well."

"I just want to learn how to make their videos faster and just improve every day and have more experience. Travel. Because I have this financial freedom right now. I can travel and work from anywhere."
```

**Joseph:**

```
"If we just imagine this situation where two years from now your girlfriend goes to med school and you are making $100K a year from editing, and you say to her that you don't need to work a job because I'm going to be able to provide for both of us: how would that feel?" - [Artem's question]

"Being able to provide for my girlfriend is going to be amazing. Seeing her happy and stuff like that."
```

**Kimi (After Success with FTE):**

```
"When I make €4K-5K a month, obviously I can actually have cash now. Full blown cash and I can actually live properly."

"Next month I'm moving into an apartment with my friend."

"I might go learn surfing in another part of the country."
```

#### Respect & Creative Partnership

```
"The higher paying clients, they have actual respect for your time. They're professionals. They have the money." - Tayyab

"My current clients... I have to literally stay up all day. If I don't reply to them, they just start being angry or they just spam DMs." - Tayyab

"After making $5K to $10K per month, I want to have the freedom to actually work with whoever I want. The dream client." - Tayyab

"My clients are seeing me as their partner and not as their employee. They trust me with my editing." - Marti
```

#### Life Beyond Editing

```
"I want to be here for long term and not burn out anymore. I gotta be more careful." - Danyil

"Yes. I would love to have a life where I can wake up, go to the gym, which I already do, but sustain this and not be working eight, nine hours." - Rolezando

"I can actually just enjoy my afternoons and evenings with friends. I can actually live life apart from work." - Botond [after achieving success]

"I have a girlfriend, I want to travel the world with her." - Tiago

"I'm at a stage in my life where I need to stay moved out, live on my own, just kind of figure out my own problems. I'm 23 years old now." - Taylor

"My family has land near Tbilisi, and I want to build a little house there." - Lucca

"I've been out with friends much more than I've been before. And that's honestly a huge thing for me because when I started editing I actually more and more isolated myself from other people." - Botond
```

#### Pride in Work & Editing Content They Love

```
"I really like vlogs, lifestyle videos. And if it's a talking head combined with lifestyle, I really like doing that kind of stuff." - Alejo

"I want to be proud of my job. Even though I'm not gaining too much money right now, I want to see my work and say, 'Okay, this was a really good video.' I just want to be proud of myself." - Alejo

"I will probably be doing a happier job where I can plan out. Because editing ads, they are really a format that you repeat every ad, but it really takes time. Not creative at all." - Rolezando

"I actually feel that editing is something that I love doing." - Marti
```

#### Proving Themselves & Achieving Their New Identity

```
"All I can think about right now is just hitting that goal and proving myself. And fulfilling that identity that I have in my mind about the future me." - Botond

"Probably it will be more productive, but not working more hours, just getting more leverage, knowing what things are the best to do at the time, and taking more risk maybe." - Alejandro

"I want to give all my friends, my parents and my family the best life I could give them. And making $1.5K/month is not enough to do that." - Tiago

"If I have a personal space, I think I can do much better focused on my work." - Aditya [wants to move out from parents]

"I want to make video editing my full time career. You need to hit $10K in order to not work this miserable 9 to 5 that you don't like or study at the university that you don't like." - Nikos
```

## PART 4: THE GAP (What's Stopping Them)

### A. Stated Obstacles

#### Don't Know How to Land High-Paying Clients

```
"I tried to attract high-paying clients but I wasn't able to attract them just yet." - Golden

"I actually don't know. I post my work, but I can't make my work shown to only the high-paying clients." - Ahmed

"The thing I feel like I was doing wrong is outreaching before I have a portfolio and good work to show." - Planet

"I know what niche I want to work in but I don't know how to reach out to them." - Ziscol

"I've never really done outreach. Finding prospects was always the hard part for me." - Belo

"I did try this a few times, posting on Twitter and Instagram and TikTok, but it didn't work. That's the truth." - Rolezando

"Most people I reach out to, if it does get to negotiation stage and I name a price that's higher than your average Indian, they're like, 'Oh yeah, I was expecting way less.'" - Taylor
```

#### Fear of Raising Rates

```
"Can I tell him to raise prices if there are no results? The views haven't risen up." - Ezequiel

"I'm afraid that they will say no after I raise my rates."

"I tried to raise my prices and I lost some clients."

"I feel like you can't really just say, 'Hey, can I get paid more?' Because they're gonna go find another person." - HamoZ
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I'm scared I might lose him or something like that." [on raising prices with his client]

"Even the fitness podcast client is new, so we've been working on four podcasts. She's the biggest client I have and I don't want to increase on her since the work is really good."
```

#### Fear of Taking on More Clients (Burnout Cycle)

```
"That's the thing I'm even scared from: taking on even more clients, having too much work, and burning out. Because it had happened before where I would have four clients and I would work more than 12 hours a day. And I'd be like, 'Oh my God, okay, I gotta drop somebody, I can't do this.'" - HamoZ

"I feel like even right now, even if I take on more clients, it's just gonna be the same thing. I'm gonna make $4,000 a month and that's it. I feel like I could do more." - HamoZ
```

#### Imposter Syndrome

```
"I sometimes think that maybe I'm not even that good for that kind of money. Because sometimes I think that people work with me only because of one point: that I'm always on time. If clients say 'we need a video at that time,' the video will be done from me. But it's not about a good video. It's about video on time." - Dmitry

"Even though clients pay me $200/video, is it even worth that?"

"One of my other issues was I see these guys on Twitter posting, and I think that my work is not good enough like those guys." - Nazeem

"I'm always skeptical. There's always... in my editing, it could always be better based on how I mark myself." - Botond

"Maybe kind of in a way more professional looking. I don't think I'm there yet, but maybe I am, and I'm just putting myself down. I don't know." - Joseph
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I feel like I don't have clear defined style on the editing, and my work seems pretty inconsistent. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's really trash."

"I feel it especially when I try to post previews. I'm trying to post weekly, and sometimes it just turns out shit. Sometimes it turns out really bomb."
```

---

### B. Unstated Obstacles (What They Hint At)

#### Skill Gaps They Can't Name (Storytelling)

```
"What more is there to that? What is actually storytelling? Because you have a video, I just have a person talking and then I have to think about storytelling." - HamoZ

"I have kind of a feel of, okay, this section of the video feels slower, this section feels fast. But if you asked me to explain it, I couldn't. I don't know how to actually structure that video, put it into words and why I'm doing the things that I'm doing." - RtFromSpace

"I'm pretty confident in visuals and stuff. But now I've been focusing on how to build environments and how to make the video sound fuller, how to make the visuals more impactful. And the only thing lacking is something that I've never purely focused on, which is storytelling." - RtFromSpace

"I think that I may be missing something on the psychological part of video editing from the viewer side. So retention, storytelling, that type of stuff." - Antonello

"I think that my overall skills: motion graphics, sound effects, those type of stuff, is okay. In my opinion, I could improve, but some people say I'm crazy good. But I want to know why my videos don't perform how I think." - Antonello

"Getting the pacing right in the video. I can do things in After Effects, but not finding the perfect music transition or the perfect sound effect." - Mazil

"I've been following your posts since six months ago, and you keep talking about how editors spend a lot of time on animations and they don't keep the basic thing, the fundamentals. I think I'm lacking in that stuff: how to use music, sound effects, how to make a video engaging." - Alejo
```

**Marti (Before FTE):**

```
"I've never heard the term pacing. I didn't even know what pacing is."
```

**Kimi (The Skill Plateau):**

```
"I felt like I was in a bit of a skill plateau. The improvement I'm making is barely enough."

"I kind of always defaulted to a style and I never really liked it and I didn't really know how to get away from it."

"I've been posting on Twitter for years now and I'm at $3K-4K a month."
```

#### The Comfort Zone Trap (Comfortable But Miserable)

```
"I kind of don't want to drop them just because I know they're actually a good channel when they're just going through a rough period." - Calus [hesitation to let go of underperforming clients]

"I still work with that client." - André [despite poor pay]

"I'm still staying with my parents too. So I don't have crazy expenses. It just feels like everything is there right now, in case anything fails." - Brian

"Due to some issues, including the issues with video editing, I said, 'Nah, let's go back to my parents home, try to build something sustainable and then take the next step.'" - Tiago

"I don't have it that bad at home. I've got a house I can move back into and all that. So it's not the end of the world." - Taylor
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I mean I'm not too mad about it because I know if I put in the work, I can reach, I can make the money. And I'm not too down if I make a bit less. Some months I'm just trying to improve."

"I think the reason is actually I think that I can get to $5K by my own. I just wanted to join in to maybe have that boost."
```

**Ezequiel's Analogy:**

```
"The frog being boiled slowly. If I told you it was $100 degrees, you would jump out immediately. But since it's going slowly, you just don't jump out."
```

---

### C. Internal vs. External Barriers

#### Internal Barriers

**Confidence & Belief:**
* Self-doubt: "I don't think I'm there yet, but maybe I am, and I'm just putting myself down"
* Imposter syndrome: Can't justify premium rates despite having skills
* Catastrophizing: Creating worst-case scenarios that paralyze action
* Comfort zone: Not uncomfortable enough to push through fear

**Skill/Knowledge Gaps:**
* Missing fundamentals: Can't explain storytelling, pacing, why videos work
* Can't articulate value: Don't understand what separates them from competition
* Business ignorance: Don't know how to position, price, or package services
* No framework: No mental model for client acquisition or retention

**Behavioral Patterns:**
* Procrastination: Waiting for perfect clarity before acting
* Overthinking: Analysis paralysis from information overload
* People-pleasing: Can't set boundaries or say no to revisions
* Perfectionism: Spending too long on details clients don't notice

**Emotional Blocks:**
* Anxiety: Daily stress about clients dropping them
* Nervousness: Getting "really nervous" with new clients
* Fear: Afraid of rejection, failure, judgment
* Past trauma: Unresolved confidence issues

#### External Barriers

**Client/Market Issues:**
* Wrong platforms: Stuck on Upwork/Fiverr with race-to-bottom pricing
* Wrong clients: Working with creators who can't afford premium rates
* No network: Don't have relationships with successful creators
* Market ignorance: Don't know where high-paying clients hang out

**Resource Constraints:**
* Time poverty: Already working 40+ hours on current clients
* Financial stress: Making "just enough" creates fear of change
* Living situation: Distractions from family, no dedicated workspace
* Language barriers: English fluency concerns for international editors

**Circumstantial:**
* Family pressure: Daily comments about "getting a real job"
* Cultural context: Eastern European/Latin American money mindset
* Life obligations: Need to support family financially
* Geography: Harder to reach English-speaking premium market

---

### D. The Real Gap They Don't See

**What They THINK The Problem Is:**
* "I need more clients"
* "I need to improve my editing"
* "I need to work harder"
* "I need better luck"

**What The ACTUAL Problem Is:**
* **No positioning** - they're generalists in a specialist's game
* **No storytelling fundamentals** - compensating with effects
* **No confidence framework** - can't justify premium prices
* **No client acquisition system** - hoping for inbound without a brand
* **No leverage** - dependent on 1-2 clients who can drop them
* **No accountability** - procrastinating on growth while meeting client deadlines

**The Invisible Obstacle:**
* **They don't know what they don't know:** "I don't know what I'm missing" appears repeatedly
* **They're optimizing the wrong things:** Spending hours on animations instead of pacing
* **They're answering the wrong question:** "How do I get more clients?" instead of "How do I become worth $1K/video?"

---

## PART 5: OBJECTIONS & RESISTANCE

### A. Spoken Objections

#### **Price/Affordability** [MOST COMMON]

```
"It's still a bit a lot for me. To be honest." - Omar

"I hate to be that guy that just came there and goes 'Yo, I can't join your coaching program,' but I don't have the money right now." - Tayyab

"Literally what I'm struggling with is if I can afford now. And if I look at my account, I don't have that much money to afford now. I have been broke for a while." - Omar

"If I had the money, I would directly pay that. No doubt. But with the money that I have right now, it's a bit difficult." - Omar

"Can we do a payment plan, like four monthly payments?" - Lucca

"$3K... That's way above my budget. Way above what I even ever expected. I genuinely can't afford it." - Golden
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I don't think I can do that. It's a bit much. I was actually thinking $1.1K, $1.2K, $1.5K. This is almost double."

"I don't even have $1.2K in my bank right now."
```

#### Need to Consult Others

```
"My dad doesn't understand the online business space very much, but still it's a big investment for me. I think I need to talk to my parents before investing." - Meet
```

**Artem's Response:**

```
"What do you want to hear from him? The only person who's going to be accountable for getting to $3K per month is you. And usually, what I found with trying to talk to someone, your parents: it's usually just offloading the accountability. Because like you mentioned a few times, it's scary. And I get that it's scary. It's supposed to be scary just because that fear is going to move you to take action."
```

**Meet's Realization:**

```
"Yeah, bro. You made a really good point there though. It's like you opened my eyes."
```

#### Timing/Readiness

```
"Maybe next month because they pay me not per video but once a month." - Ezequiel

"By the end of this month, I'm gonna save up money to begin it." - Dinal

"It's like one month of my salary, so... Yeah, I think I should give some time to think." - Meet
```

---

### B. Unspoken Objections (Implied Through Hesitation)

#### Fear of Being Scammed/Wasting Money

```
"Maybe it's because I have never invested in something like this before. So I have no idea if these things work or not." - Meet

"I guess so. I think, I hope." - Ezequiel [When asked if program will work]

"There were options of me getting coaching and communities all along my journey, but it was also a thing that I procrastinated on and I never took action until now." - Botond

"I was kind of skeptical because most of the times I've joined a community or a mentorship, it didn't really help me. I just wasted my money." - Marti

"If I'm gonna invest $1K or $2K into the program, I need to be sure that I should be getting the results. If I'm putting all the work, like I'm doing everything, and I don't see the results, then what?" - Kris
```

**David (Lithuania):**

```
"I think the reason is actually I think that I can get to $5K by my own. I just wanted to join in to maybe have that boost. But right now it seems, it seems stupid, but I thought it will cost way less."
```

#### Cultural Money Block

```
"I'm from Ukraine, so I know exactly how it is in terms of the mentality around money. Up until two years ago, I was so uncomfortable spending $20 on a subscription or just any amount of money on anything." - Artem [relating to prospects]
```

---

### C. Past Failures & Skepticism

#### Previous Attempts That Didn't Work

```
"I had some previews to post on Twitter, but my reach is dead. So I'm scared to post them." - Sam

"I was sending 300 to 400 emails per day. None of them really converted to good clients." - Ziscol

"I got some guidance on it from different people, and I have been consistent for a long time. But as I said, it was low-quality inbounds, not the high-paying ones." - Ahmed

"I even try to reach out to them, but they haven't seen my messages." - Ziscol
```

#### Previous Bad Experience with Coaching

**Marti:**

```
"Coaches are scam. They just took my money and didn't really help me."

"It wasn't a personal connection. It was paying to have YouTube free videos inside a paid community."

"People were not really explaining why. They were just telling me stuff and not really trying to help me."
```

**Kimi (Why Other Programs Don't Work):**

```
"Every other course I've taken is not advanced enough. They mostly take you from zero to a few grand a month. They can't really help you get to 8K-10K per month."

"It just says, yeah, post on Twitter. But I've been doing that for years now, and I'm at $3K-4K a month."

"I'm in the Editing Layer right now. It's not really giving the real source to scale to 10K a month."
```

#### Annoying Clients & Middleman Agencies

```
"I just hate it, bro. I don't know how people do it every week with agencies. It feels like I've gone from one soul sucking nine to five job to now an online soul sucking job. Waking up in the morning, forcing myself to work." - Taylor

"I get a lot of DMs. The problem is all of them are agency owners and all of them offer $200." - Ahmed

"I have reputable people in my DMs who outreach to me but my problem with them is that they are all agencies. Not creators." - Botond
```

---

## PART 6: DECISION-MAKING PSYCHOLOGY

### A. What Would Make Them Say Yes

#### Pre-Sale Value Delivery

```
"You really helped me even before I was in the community. Even before I was in the program, on our call just for me to investigate what is inside, you helped me and I got instant results." - Marti
```

#### Proof/Social Proof

```
"I've seen your videos and the people that are there, the people that interact with you: they seem that it has worked for them." - Ezequiel

"I literally watch your free videos, and I decided to discipline myself to not take on work priced lower than me. It's paid off. So I'm excited to see how the one-to-one coaching would be." - Dinal

"Hearing you guys talk about how you charge $1K per video without even thinking twice about it really puts it into perspective for me." - Sumon [after joining FTE]

"If there's someone who has been at my place, at my situation and achieved the goals where I want to be, then there's actually almost no reason to be scared."

"To make it from 8 to 10 [confidence in program] is definitely me being able to see the results. But it doesn't have to be me. Some testimonials from guys that actually did it. That's a plus for me." - Kris
```

#### Personalization & Specificity

```
"A lot of community owners will literally ghost you, block you. You're not getting results in a month? You need to be longer there." - Tayyab [expressing what they DON'T want]

"That's actually really good that you actually check on the editors you have worked with and you actually care about that." - Tayyab

"I've never had this kind of attitude to me. People were always just giving me these answers that are just for the general people who are editing, not especially for me." - Marti

"The thing is that you are going in depth. I have never hired a coach before but I have watched many coaches that are helping editors to improve but they are not going in depth onto many things. You are going into depth and you will keep your focus on the pressure points." - Planet
```

**Taylor (On The Value of Simple Advice):**

```
"You just teach all these little things that are so minor, they're so small and simple, but they make all the fucking difference. As soon as you implement even one or two of those things, your edits just look so much better, so much more premium, so much more clean."

"Joining the mentorship. 100%. That was literally like, everything changed from there. I don't know where I'd be now if I hadn't joined."
```

#### Community

```
"My favorite part was that I could literally reach out to you anytime and you would help me with anything. And the group calls are just straight up fire. The guys in the community are so nice. These group calls literally made my day. They were so fun." - Botond

"Community is the thing. I would love to join. Being with the community who is already earning $5K to $10K, $3K to $5K, it will be more motivating for me to work more and be consistent." - Sujal

"The most useful I think is obviously the one-on-one strategy calls and also the community of people who are in the same boat." - Meet
```

**Taylor (The Loneliness of Editing):**

```
"Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video. Sometimes there's not much social life outside of it when you are locked in."

"The main thing inside the program for me was the group calls. Having those group calls quite a few times a week with the boys inside the program: they're all legends. It's something to look forward to because you might be locked in all day and you might be stressed. But having that group call gets you in a good mood again and lights the fire back in you. It motivates you."
```

#### Clear Roadmap

```
"I want to get there with the systems. Because I know I'll be doing something that's proven to be right. Because you have gotten there." - Mazil

"This looks amazing." - Botond [after seeing program structure]

"I think this will help me reach my goals. I'm very confident." - Lindsey
```

#### The "What If Everything Stays The Same?" Question

This question creates instant clarity through future regret visualization. The pattern across calls:

**Tiago:**

```
"If everything stayed the same, I can say that I wasted another year. Right now, the past year, I don't look at it as a waste because I learned so much. But if I just stay the same one year from now, I think I would definitely think that I wasted another year."
```

**Sam:**

```
"What happens if we have the same conversation a year from now and you're still at $1K?" - [Artem's question]

"That would be depressing."
```

**David (Lithuania) - The 10-Second Silence:**

```
"You've been stuck around this stage for six months at this point. And in terms of your action plan to really getting to not even $5K but to $3K per month: you said you would need to raise your prices, but you're not sure how to do that." - [Artem setting context]

"What happens if we literally have the same exact conversation half a year later and you're in the same position pretty much as you are right now? How would that feel?" - [Artem's question]

[10 seconds of silence]

"Yeah, that's a good point. Is there any chance we can do like, 800 right now... payment plan split? Because I don't even have $1.2K in my bank right now."
```

**Analysis:** The question created instant decision. Before it, David was saying the price was "too much" and he thought he could get there on his own. After 10 seconds of silence contemplating another 6 months stuck, he immediately asked for a payment plan and joined.

---

### B. What Would Make Them Say No

**Deal-Breakers:**
* Generic, non-personalized advice
* No accountability or follow-up
* Feeling judged for their current situation
* "Need to talk to parents" - offloading accountability
* "Need to think about it" - no emotional urgency created
* Already in another program (qualified poorly)
* True financial stress (can't afford groceries)
* Comfortable being stuck (frog in boiling water)

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
* Asking about payment plans before understanding value
* No emotional response to the "What If" question
* Defending their current situation instead of wanting change
* Blaming external factors exclusively

---

### C. Green Flags (Who Joins and Succeeds)

* Living with parents (low expenses, perfect timing window)
* Stuck 6+ months at same income (pent-up frustration)
* Strong family/relationship motivation (support parents, provide for girlfriend)
* Previous bad coaching experience (differentiation opportunity)
* Emotional goals beyond money (travel, freedom, family)
* Quality over quantity mindset (not volume grinders)
* Already consuming Artem's free content (pre-sold on approach)
* Asks specific questions about the program (engaged, not passive)

---

## PART 7: IDENTITY & SELF-PERCEPTION

### A. How They See Themselves Currently

#### Self-Labels

* "Not a beginner anymore" - Common self-identification
* "Full-time editor" - But not making full-time income
* "I don't have a normal job" - Identity caught between worlds
* Working hard but "not getting results" proportional to effort

#### What They're Proud Of

```
"I'm getting better every video. He's pretty happy right now." - Tayyab

"My editing was pretty bad. But now it's pretty good." - Ezequiel

"I understand the product and target audience really well for this client specifically. So it's easier." - Danyil

"When I need to get a video done, I instantly sat down the next day at 6am and started editing and wanted to finish as fast as I can so I can please my client the best." - Botond
```

#### What They're Ashamed Of

```
"The reason why I started with DaVinci is because I actually didn't have the money to pay the subscription, and I didn't want to make money from cracked apps." - Ahmed

"I felt pretty bad about it because I told myself before that I was going to lock in." - Botond

"I hate to be that guy [who can't afford to pay]." - Tayyab

"I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem." - David
```

### B. How They Want to Be Seen

#### Aspirational Identity Markers

* "A premium editor, not just another freelancer"
* "Someone who charges $1K per video without thinking twice"
* "Editor who works with dream clients"
* "Making more than friends and parents"
* "Someone who is passionate about their work and gets paid well for it"
* "A creative partner, not a replaceable vendor"

#### Who They Compare Themselves To

* Editors charging $1K+ per video in the community
* "Top editors" they follow on Twitter
* Artem's success story ($8-10K/month)
* Friends with "normal jobs" who make more
* Their future self who has "made it"

#### The Identity Transformation They're Seeking

**From → To:**

* From "Just Editing" → "Building My Future"
* From "Current Me" → "Future Successful Me"
* From "Stuck/Directionless" → "Taking Action"
* From "Proving It to Others" → "Proving It to Myself"
* From "Isolated" → "Part of a Community"
* From "Replaceable" → "Irreplaceable"

**Andre (On Feeling Replaceable):**

```
"It feels like we're easily replaced. The goal of the editor is to become irreplaceable."

"There are a lot of editors, but most of them just don't care about even putting the effort. They just want to release the edit as fast as possible and it looks like shit, but they don't care."
```

```
"All I can think about right now is just hitting that goal and proving myself. And fulfilling that identity that I have in my mind about the future me." - Botond
```

## PART 9: PATTERNS & INSIGHTS

### A. Universal Pain Points

**1. The Stuck-at-$1-2K Ceiling**

Nearly every prospect is in the $1-2K/month range despite working full-time hours. This creates the frustrating math: 40+ hours/week = part-time income.

Key insight: They're not lazy. They're working hard at the wrong things, or working hard without systems.

**2. The Accountability Paradox**

They will NEVER miss a client deadline: they'll wake up at 2am with a fever to ship a video. But they'll procrastinate indefinitely on their own growth because there's no external deadline.

This is why courses don't work for them. They need accountability, not more information.

**3. Failed Client Acquisition**

Universal experience of outreach failures (ghosting, low response rates) and Twitter posts that "flop." This creates learned helplessness around prospecting.

Many have tried 300-400 emails per day with zero results. The problem isn't volume: it's positioning, targeting, and messaging.

**4. Fear of Raising Rates**

Deep psychological block around asking for more money. Past experiences of losing clients when raising prices reinforces the fear.

The fear is often worse than the reality. When they do raise rates, clients often say yes (like Marti's $1K per video story).

**5. The Comfort Zone Trap**

Making "just enough" to survive keeps them from taking risks. Current clients, though underpaying, provide security.

The frog in boiling water analogy resonates strongly. They're being slowly boiled by comfort.

**6. Lack of Direction**

"I don't know what I'm doing" sentiment. They know they need to do something different but don't know what.

They need a roadmap, not more tactics. Clarity beats information.

---

### B. Shared Aspirations

**1. Premium Clients Over Volume**

Strong preference for 2-3 high-paying clients over 10+ low-paying ones. They value relationship quality over transaction quantity.

"Quality over quantity" is a core identity marker, not just a preference.

**2. Financial Peace (Not Wealth)**

The goal isn't to be "rich" - it's to not worry about money. To buy things without checking prices. To know next month's income is secure.

$5K/month isn't about the number: it's about what it represents: stability, options, respect.

**3. Creative Fulfillment**

They want to edit content they're passionate about, not just whatever pays. The dream is alignment between work and passion.

"Soul sucking" work is a deal-breaker, even if it pays well.

**4. Respect & Partnership**

Being treated as a creative partner, not a replaceable vendor. Clients who "respect their time."

The identity shift from "vendor" to "partner" matters more than the income shift.

---

### C. Segmentation Patterns

#### By Experience Level

**Newer Editors (1-2 years):**
* More focused on skill development
* Often working with one main client
* Still figuring out their niche
* More likely to mention After Effects or specific software gaps
* Higher imposter syndrome
* Questions: "What is storytelling?" / "What do $1K videos look like?"

**More Experienced (3+ years):**
* Frustrated by rates declining despite skill growth
* More business-focused concerns
* Often tried multiple niches or approaches
* More cynical about the market ("rates going down")
* Burned out from overwork
* Already have skills: missing positioning and systems

#### By Geographic/Cultural Background

**Eastern European/Latin American:**
* Stronger family financial pressure
* Parents often don't understand freelancing
* Lower local costs create different pricing psychology
* Living with parents is more common/accepted
* "$3K/month is a lot" mentality creates income ceiling
* Need to see someone from similar background succeed

**US/UK/Western:**
* More pressure to "move out" and be independent
* Higher cost of living creates more financial stress at $1-2K/month
* More likely to mention lifestyle goals (travel, location independence)
* Health insurance considerations (Brian's 2-year window)
* Different relationship with money/investment

#### By Living Situation

**Living with Parents:**
* Built-in safety net reduces urgency
* BUT also creates family pressure to "get a real job"
* Often need to prove freelancing is legitimate
* May offload accountability to parents ("I need to talk to my parents first")
* Lower expenses = perfect timing window to take risks

**Living Independently/With Partner:**
* Higher financial pressure = more urgency
* Provider motivation (Joseph for girlfriend, Tiago for girlfriend)
* Risk tolerance often lower (can't afford to fail)
* More concrete "why" behind income goals

---

### D. Surprising Discoveries

#### What They Care About MORE Than Expected

**1. Personalization**

They've been burned by generic programs. The mention of "you actually check on the editors" resonates deeply. Generic advice feels like a betrayal.

**2. Community/Not Being Alone**

"Hearing you guys talk about how you charge $1K per video" - they need to see others like them succeeding. Isolation is a major pain point.

**Taylor's insight on the loneliness of editing:**

```
"Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video. Sometimes there's not much social life outside of it when you are locked in."
```

This loneliness makes community and group calls disproportionately valuable: not for the content, but for the human connection with others who understand the struggle.

**3. Family Dynamics**

Parents' opinions matter significantly. Many need to "prove" freelancing is legitimate. This is an emotional driver, not just logistics.

**4. Quality of Life**

Work-life balance, not burning out, having time for exercise and friends: these aren't afterthoughts. They've experienced burnout and fear it.

**5. The "Why" Behind Money**

Providing for girlfriend, supporting parents, traveling with loved ones, building a house on family land: these specific dreams drive action more than abstract income goals.

#### What They Care About LESS Than Expected

**1. Specific Tactics**

Less interested in "hacks" and more in proven systems and personalized guidance. Tactics without strategy = more confusion.

**2. Software/Technical Skills**

Most feel technically competent. The gap is business/positioning, not editing ability. They can do After Effects: they can't do storytelling.

**3. Fame/Status**

They don't want to be famous editors: they want financial peace and creative fulfillment. "Big name" isn't the goal.

---

### E. Counter-Intuitive Insights

**1. The "Scared" Frame Works**

Prospects frequently describe the investment as "scary." Acknowledging and normalizing this fear ("It's supposed to be scary") is powerful. Don't minimize the fear: leverage it.

**2. Parents as Hidden Objection**

"Talking to parents" often means offloading accountability. Addressing this directly increases conversions. Parents will usually say no because they don't understand online business.

**3. Past Success = Present Frustration**

Many mention rates were BETTER 2 years ago. Success in the past makes current plateau more painful. They know what's possible. That's why being stuck hurts.

**4. Money Doesn't Solve the Motivation Problem**

Some prospects who reach their initial income goals lose motivation because money wasn't the real goal. David went from $2K to $3.2K and felt his "fire burning out." The "why" beyond money matters.

**5. Skill ≠ Income**

Editors with objectively great skills (motion graphics, effects, speed) are stuck at low rates. The bottleneck is rarely technical ability: it's positioning, business skills, and confidence.

**6. Information Overload Creates Paralysis**

Many have consumed tons of free content and are MORE confused, not less. They need a single path to follow, not more options.

**7. Physical Health Improves When Income Stabilizes**

Kimi's smartwatch tracked his stress levels. Before FTE, it showed "high stress zone: 2 hours" daily. After getting consistent inbounds and client stability, his stress levels normalized. Financial anxiety isn't just emotional: it has measurable physical effects. Solving the income problem solves health problems they didn't even name.

```
"I'm not as stressed anymore, which is actually a huge thing for me. And now I'm actually more healthy. I can actually see a difference in my average life. I'm actually a healthy being now."
```

---

### F. The Core Psychology

#### The 5 Lacks That Keep Editors Stuck

After analyzing all transcripts, every stuck editor is missing some combination of:

1. **Pricing Confidence** - They don't believe they're worth more
2. **Business Systems** - They're winging client acquisition
3. **Storytelling Mastery** - They can't articulate why their editing matters
4. **External Accountability** - They procrastinate on growth activities
5. **Community of Peers** - They're isolated, don't know what's possible

#### The Money Mindset Block

Country context creates an income ceiling in their mind:
* Bulgarian editors think $3K/month is "a lot"
* Hungarian editors are impressed making what "40-year-olds make at jobs"
* Indian editors see $1K/month as "huge money"

**The breakthrough comes when they:**
* See someone from similar background succeed at higher levels
* Are told directly "your work is worth more"
* Experience the feeling of charging more and getting "yes"

#### The Fear That Drives Everything

**Surface fear:** "What if I can't afford this?"

**Real fear:** "What if I invest and nothing changes? What if I'm the one person who fails? What if my editing actually isn't good enough and this exposes me?"

The investment fear is actually fear of discovering they're not capable.

#### The Desire That Drives Everything

**Surface desire:** "$5K/month" or "$1K per video"

**Real desire:** "I want my family to be proud of me. I want to prove this wasn't a mistake. I want to wake up excited about my work. I want to not check prices before buying things. I want to matter."

Money is ALWAYS a proxy for respect, validation, and identity transformation.

---

### G. The Central Truth

**Money is never the real goal. It's a proxy for identity transformation.**

They want to become someone who:
* Deserves respect from clients
* Makes family proud
* Can provide for loved ones
* Proves freelancing was the right choice
* Matters

Every piece of copy, every sales conversation, every piece of content should speak to this identity transformation: not just the income outcome.

The question isn't "Do you want to make $5K/month?"

The question is **"Who do you want to become?"**

## APPENDIX: KEY TRANSFORMATION STORIES

### Marti (Bulgaria, 16): $150 → $6.5K/month

**Before:**
```
"I was not outreaching. I was feeling that my edits are not competitive. I was thinking that the top editors are getting $500 bucks max per video."
```

**The Shift:**
```
"Artem was like, 'No, I charge $2,500 per video.' And I was like, 'What?' That changed my whole mindset."

"I'll not edit for any client unless I like the price."
```

**After:**
```
"I charge $1K per video. He was like, 'Yeah, that works.' And I was like, 'What the fuck did I just do?'"

"This month I've done $6.5K. My dream clients are paying me very well. I have financial freedom. I can travel and work from anywhere."
```

### Botond (Hungary, 18): $300/video → $2K/video

**Before:**
```
"$300 per video was mind blowing for me."

"I woke up at 2am with fever just to ship the video to him."

"When it comes to helping myself with outreaching, I just procrastinated on it for days."
```

**The Experience:**
```
"The guys in the community are so nice. The group calls literally made my day."

"I could literally reach out to you anytime and you would help me with anything."
```

**After:**
```
"When I paid, felt weird seeing money withdrawn. But literally in first month I made back more. No brainer."

"Signing clients paying $2K per video."

"I can actually just enjoy my afternoons and evenings with friends. I can actually live life apart from work."
```

### David (Lithuania): The Stuck Editor Who Decided

**Before:**
```
"I've been stuck at this stage for six months at this point."

"I think that I don't have a problem, but I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem."

"I'm scared I might lose him or something like that." [on raising prices]
```

**The Decision Moment:**
```
"What happens if we literally have the same exact conversation half a year later and you're in the same position?" - [Artem's question]

[10 seconds of silence]

"Yeah, that's a good point."
```

### Brian (USA): The Escape Plan

**Before:**
```
"I tracked my sleep. Only 2-3 days hit seven hours. Averaging 4-5 hours."

"Taking a toll on all aspects of my life."

"I would still always try to be a video editor. But stuck in that loop where I'm editing for the low end clients and not being able to make it an actual career."
```

**The Decision:**
```
"I've been getting this feeling of wanting to quit the 9-5 even more in my heart."

"This is just the best time for me to pursue something instead of going to the future and living a life of regret not knowing what could have been."
```

### Taylor (UK): From Warehouse Freezer to $4K/month Client

**Before:**
```
"I worked in a warehouse in the freezer, literal minus 27 degrees. I was working in the freezer with food every single day."

"Months of just shitty client work, low paying jobs, just shitty jobs in general, learning a lot at the same time."

"Everything needed to change. Everything. And I never did talking heads at that point."

"It was a bit discouraging. I felt like I was just hitting my head on a brick wall. You're doing outreach, posting bangers that are doing well on Twitter and nothing's coming from it."
```

**The Struggle:**
```
"It come to month two in Thailand. The money was running low. It was looking like I had to leave."

"I kind of set my mind to the fact that I'm never going to work a job again. I'm not going back to that."

"I kind of got to the point where it was like, okay, I'm gonna get rich or die trying at this point. Because I was like, I'm not doing this for the rest of my fucking life."
```

**The Experience:**
```
"Just like overall with editing, definitely joining the mentorship. 100%, because that was literally like, everything changed from there. I don't know where I'd be now if I hadn't joined."

"You just teach all these little things that are so minor, they're so small and simple, but they make all the fucking difference. As soon as you implement even one or two of those things, your edits just look so much better, so much more premium, so much more clean."

"The main thing inside the program for me was the group calls. Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video. Having those group calls quite a few times a week with the boys inside the program: they're all legends. It gets you in a good mood again and lights the fire back in you."
```

**The Breakthrough:**
```
"I posted a re-edit on Twitter. Literally the first day it done like 60 impressions and 4 likes. I thought this was a banger. I was so disappointed. Then I woke up the next day and it was on 20 likes, but then it was all popping off. End of the day, it was 140 likes. I was getting a ton of inbounds."

"The 1st of January, new year, first day of the new year, I got a DM from Stan. I couldn't believe it man. I know him as a YouTuber. I actually used to watch him a few years ago. As soon as I saw the name, I knew who it was straight away."

"It was $1K a week. So basically a $4K a month job."
```

**The Mindset Shift:**
```
"A guy on YouTube with 11 million subscribers has reached out to me because he likes my work. That's crazy to me. That's fucking insane. Especially after eight, nine months of editing. It just kind of lit the fire in me even more."

"Is my editing that good? I didn't even think it was. I think it was better but I didn't think it was that good."
```

### Kimi (Germany, 17): $400/video → €2,000/video

**Before:**
```
"I didn't really know how to get clients. Actually, I had clients mainly mostly because of just luck. I was kind of holding on to that. That's how I made money. But I didn't really know how to actually get clients myself from scratch."

"I felt like I was in a bit of a skill plateau as well."

"In terms of my editing skill, I still feel like a bit stuck. But the improvement I'm making is barely enough."

"I've been posting on Twitter for years now and I'm at $3K-4K a month."
```

**The Stress:**
```
"Before, like January, December, November, I was always really stressed because I knew that the clients could always just stop working with me. And I didn't really have any backup and I didn't really get any inbounds. So I was incredibly stressed. Really stressed."

"In the Discord, it always sent things like, 'okay, today, high stress zone, two hours.' And everyone was making fun of me. That was like October times."
```

**The Experience:**
```
"The reviews of the videos really helped me. You saying how I'm always defaulting to a style. And then I made the next videos and those were viral Twitter videos. That was the biggest thing."

"The referrals you gave me to the clients that are paying €2K and €1K made me also way more confident in charging higher prices."
```

**The Breakthrough:**
```
"It was weeks and weeks of just basically nothing and I was doing practice edits. I was improving, going through the skill plateau, but I still had basically nothing. And then I had one evening of just four inbounds. And then Daniel Bitton, and I started charging €2K. That was really lit."

"I'm charging him a fat €2,000 per vlog."

"Now I'm getting inbounds that are paying €800 or €1K for a video." [Was $400 before]

"I never ask budget. People never really tell me the budget. I just tell them a price. Currently that's €1,000 or €1,500."
```

**The Transformation:**
```
"I'm not as stressed anymore, which is actually a huge thing for me. And now I'm actually more healthy. I can actually see a difference in my average life. I'm actually a healthy being now."

"Now I don't have the high stress zone anymore."

"When I make €4K-5K a month, obviously I can actually have cash now. Full blown cash and I can actually live properly."

"What am I most proud of? I'm most proud of the safety."
```

**On Why FTE Was Different:**
```
"Every other course I've taken is not advanced enough. They mostly take you from zero to a few grand a month. They can't really help you get to 8K-10K per month. And your courses are directly made on business and talking head videos, which is perfect. You learn so much from someone who is directly in your niche."
```

### **Andre (Portugal): The Mental State Journey** [Currently In Program]

**The Struggle:**
```
"My mental state comes and goes."

"This last year I made quite a lot less money than the previous year. I made €10K less from one year to the other and it's quite depressing."

"Last year, there was a month I made €100. It was absolutely awful. Last year was a piece of shit. I hated last year."

"I had a girlfriend for two years that I really committed to the relationship and I just had to break up with her in June and I'm still struggling with it. We had plans and stuff like that, but she didn't reciprocate what I gave her."

"I also lost my grandfather last year. So it was a piece of shit year."

"This year has to be better. This has to be the year."
```

**On Feeling Replaceable:**
```
"Right now I basically have one consistent client and that's it. And it's very scary, always thinking about next month."

"It feels like we're easily replaced. The goal of the editor is to become irreplaceable."

"There are a lot of editors, but most of them just don't care about even putting the effort. They just want to release the edit as fast as possible and it looks like shit, but they don't care."
```

**The Hope:**
```
"The good side of it is it cannot get worse, right?"

"Even if I can't get these good clients, at least I'll have more portfolio to show and get new and better clients."
```
