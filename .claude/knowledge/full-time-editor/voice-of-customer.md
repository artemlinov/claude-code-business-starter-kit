# FTE™ VOICE OF CUSTOMER

*How the Skilled-But-Stuck Video Editor Speaks and Thinks*

All quotes extracted from 30+ sales calls, coaching calls, and success interviews.

---

## THE CORE TRUTH

Your prospect is NOT a beginner. They know how to edit. They have clients. They're making *some* money. But they're trapped in what feels like quicksand: the more they work, the more exhausted they get, and yet the income needle barely moves.

They look at other editors charging $1K+ per video and think: "I could do that... but I don't know what I'm missing."

Money is never the real goal. It's a proxy for identity transformation. They want to become someone who deserves respect: from clients, family, and most importantly, from themselves.

---

## WHO THEY ARE

### The "Quality Over Quantity" Identity

They genuinely believe in doing great work, not just fast work. They see themselves as artists, not assembly line workers. This belief is both their strength and their limitation: they overdeliver but undercharge.

```
"I'm more of a quality over quantity guy. Yeah, definitely." - Dinal

"Even if I have two clients that pay me $2K a video, I need to be putting my soul into the video to be worth it." - Dinal

"I want to focus on quality because I want to be a better editor too. Not just making a lot of money." - Dinal
```

### The Accountability Paradox

They have extraordinary discipline for client work but zero discipline for their own growth. They'll wake up at 2am with a fever to ship a video, but procrastinate on outreach for days. The comfort zone trap isn't laziness: it's the absence of external deadlines for growth activities.

```
"When I need to get a video done, I instantly sat down the next day at 6am. But when it comes to helping myself with outreaching, I just procrastinated on it for days." - Botond

"I'm just the kind of person who when has to do things for himself, I usually procrastinate on. When there's someone holding my hand, I'm much more likely to work harder." - Botond
```

### The Loneliness Pain Point

Editing is isolating. 8-12 hours alone behind a laptop. This loneliness amplifies other problems and makes community disproportionately valuable.

```
"Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video. Sometimes there's not much social life outside of it." - Taylor

"I don't really talk to other editors." - Carlos
```

### The 9-to-5 Escape

Many come from or are fleeing traditional employment. The hatred of conventional work is visceral and deeply motivating.

```
"I worked in a warehouse in the freezer, literal minus 27 degrees every day." - Taylor

"I kind of got to the point where it was like, okay, I'm gonna get rich or die trying. Because I'm not doing this for the rest of my fucking life." - Taylor

"I've always just hated authority. Not police, but in terms of back in school I hated listening to teachers tell me what to do." - Taylor
```

### The Provider Motivation

For many, the "why" isn't personal wealth. It's providing for someone they love.

```
"My girlfriend is starting vet school next year. I want to be making $7-10K/month so she can fully commit to vet school without working a job." - Joseph

"I really want to give my girlfriend a trip to Madeira. She's spamming me every single week with TikToks and reels about Madeira." - Tiago

"All the jobs I've worked in past I got in from a relative or a friend. Video editing, how far I take it is all on me. It's a little bit of a pride thing." - Joseph
```

### The Imposter Syndrome Loop

Despite demonstrable skills, they constantly doubt their worth.

```
"I sometimes think that maybe I'm not even that good for that kind of money. Because sometimes I think that people work with me only because I'm always on time." - Dmitry

"Maybe kind of in a way more professional looking. I don't think I'm there yet, but maybe I am, and I'm just putting myself down. I don't know." - Joseph

"I'm always skeptical. There's always... in my editing, it could always be better." - Botond
```

### The Respect Craving

Beyond money, they want to be treated as creative partners, not replaceable vendors.

```
"Nowadays this is straight up non-negotiable. If the client is a dickhead, I don't care, I'm not gonna work for him. Even if the pay's twice as much." - Taylor

"It feels like we're easily replaced. The goal of the editor is to become irreplaceable." - Andre

"I'm not creative if I hate what I'm doing." - Taylor
```

---

## CURRENT STATE (Pain)

### Income Frustration

```
"For the past one year, I'm currently stuck on $1K per month." - David

"I'm charging the same from when I started. My editing was pretty bad then. But now it's pretty good. So why am I charging the same?" - Ezequiel

"I average at least 50 hours per week and sometimes have to edit on the weekends."
```

### Feeling Stuck

```
"I've been stuck at this stage for six months at this point." - David

"I think that I don't have a problem, but I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem." - David

"My story is not evolving." - Tom
```

### Client Acquisition Struggles

```
"I was getting ghosted by almost 90% of the people I outreached." - Planet

"I tried outreach. I was sending 300 to 400 emails per day. None of them really converted to good clients." - Ziscol

"The only thing I tried was posting on X but my posts were flopping hard, getting 100 impressions." - Botond
```

### Anxiety & Emotional Weight

```
"I'm desperate. My situation right now... you know what it is to go to bed and thinking about all this stuff, anxiety, waking up in the morning, the same thing. It's fucking routine." - Alejo

"It feels like I'm stuck to the desk. Like I'm chained to the desk every day. I don't reap the rewards from being at the desk that much. That's why it just feels like torture sometimes." - KP

"Right now I basically have one consistent client and that's it. And it's very scary, always thinking about next month." - Andre
```

### Family Pressure

```
"My dad thinks that I'm wasting my time and I should go and help him." - Alejo

"The biggest boundary was actually making my parents understand that I actually am doing something important and that they shouldn't bother me." - Botond

"It's peer pressure, family stuff. I'm going to economics class. It's the easiest one there. So it's just to show family that I go to university and that's it." - Belo
```

### Burnout

```
"I was constantly working 12 hours a day. After that I felt like I just can't get out of bed. I'm just really empty and depressed." - Dinal

"I tracked my sleep. Only 2-3 days hit seven hours. Averaging 4-5 hours. Taking a toll on all aspects of my life." - Brian

"I had a burnout. It took me six months to recover." - Danyil
```

### Pain Language Patterns

* "Stuck" — The single most powerful word (very high frequency)
* "Ghosted" — Universal outreach experience
* "Flopping" — X posts not performing
* "Inconsistent" — Income, clients, workflow
* "Scared/Scary" — Investment, raising prices
* "Burnt out" — The ultimate crash
* "Directionless" — No roadmap
* "Chained to the desk" — Working without reward
* "Soul sucking" — Work that drains them

```

"My clients are seeing me as their partner and not as their employee." - Marti
```

### Proving Themselves

## THE GAP

### What They Think vs. What's Actually Wrong

**What they think:** "I need more clients" / "I need to improve my editing" / "I need to work harder"

**What's actually wrong:**
* No positioning — they're generalists in a specialist's game
* No storytelling fundamentals — compensating with effects (Sparkle Syndrome™)
* No confidence framework — can't justify premium prices
* No client acquisition system — hoping for inbound without a brand
* No accountability — procrastinating on growth while meeting client deadlines

### The Skill Gap They Can't Name

```
"What is actually storytelling? Because you have a video, I just have a person talking and then I have to think about storytelling." - HamoZ

"I have kind of a feel of, okay, this section feels slower, this section feels fast. But if you asked me to explain it, I couldn't." - RtFromSpace

"I've never heard the term pacing. I didn't even know what pacing is." - Marti
```

### Fear of Raising Rates

```
"I feel like you can't really just say, 'Hey, can I get paid more?' Because they're gonna go find another person." - HamoZ

"I'm scared I might lose him or something like that." - David
```

### The Comfort Zone Trap

```
"I think the reason is actually I think that I can get to $5K by my own. I just wanted to join in to maybe have that boost." - David

"I'm still staying with my parents too. So I don't have crazy expenses. It just feels like everything is there right now." - Brian
```

---

## OBJECTIONS & RESISTANCE

### Price/Affordability (Most Common)

```
"I don't think I can do that. It's a bit much. I was actually thinking $1.1K, $1.2K." - David

"If I had the money, I would directly pay that. No doubt. But with the money that I have right now, it's a bit difficult." - Omar
```

### Need to Consult Others

```
"I think I need to talk to my parents before investing." - Meet
```

Artem's reframe: "What do you want to hear from him? The only person who's going to be accountable for getting to $3K per month is you. Usually, talking to parents is just offloading the accountability."

### Fear of Being Scammed

```
"I was kind of skeptical because most of the times I've joined a community or a mentorship, it didn't really help me. I just wasted my money." - Marti

"It wasn't a personal connection. It was paying to have YouTube free videos inside a paid community." - Marti
```

### What Overcomes Objections

* Pre-sale value delivery ("You helped me even before I was in the program")
* Social proof from similar backgrounds
* Personalization ("Answers that are especially for me, not general people")
* Community ("The guys in the community are so nice. The group calls literally made my day.")
* The "What If" question: "What happens if we have this same conversation 6 months from now?" — creates instant clarity through future regret

---

## DECISION PSYCHOLOGY

### What Makes Them Say Yes

* Pre-sale value on the call itself
* Proof from editors with similar backgrounds
* Personalized, specific advice (not generic)
* Community of similar-level editors
* Clear roadmap and structure
* The "What If Everything Stays The Same?" question

### What Makes Them Say No

* Generic, non-personalized advice
* No accountability or follow-up
* Feeling judged for current situation
* No emotional urgency created
* Already in another program
* True financial hardship

### Green Flags

* Living with parents (low expenses, perfect window to invest)
* Stuck 6+ months at same income
* Strong family/relationship motivation
* Previous bad coaching experience (differentiation opportunity)
* Already consuming free content
* Quality over quantity mindset

### Red Flags

* Complete beginners with no clients
* Just want to "see what's inside"
* Defending current situation
* Blaming external factors exclusively
* No emotional response to future-state questions

## KEY PATTERNS & INSIGHTS

### The 5 Lacks That Keep Editors Stuck

1. **Pricing Confidence** — They don't believe they're worth more
2. **Business Systems** — They're winging client acquisition
3. **Storytelling Mastery** — They can't articulate why their editing matters
4. **External Accountability** — They procrastinate on growth activities
5. **Community of Peers** — They're isolated, don't know what's possible

### The Core Psychology

**Surface fear:** "What if I can't afford this?"
**Real fear:** "What if I invest and nothing changes? What if my editing actually isn't good enough?"

**Surface desire:** "$5K/month"
**Real desire:** "I want my family to be proud of me. I want to prove this wasn't a mistake. I want to not check prices before buying things. I want to matter."

### Counter-Intuitive Insights

* "Scared" is a positive signal — fear means they care enough to be uncomfortable
* "Talk to parents" = offloading accountability — address directly
* Past success makes present plateau MORE painful
* Information overload creates paralysis — they need one path, not more options
* Physical health improves when income stabilizes (Kimi's stress watch data)
* Skill ≠ Income — the bottleneck is rarely technical ability
