# FTE FRAMEWORK DEFINITIONS

Single Source of Truth for Full-Time Editor™ Frameworks

---

# Section 1: Core Philosophies

These are the beliefs and worldview that define Full-Time Editor.

## Storytelling First™

**What it is:** The core philosophy. Master fundamentals before flash. Serve the story, not your ego.

**In practice:** Pacing, music selection, emotional arc matter more than flashy effects. Ask "what does the viewer want to see?" not "what looks cool?"

**Enemy:** Sparkle Syndrome™ (adding effects for their sake)

## The 4-2-1™ Rule

**What it is:** 4 hours make, 2 hours move, 1 hour prep. Sustainable excellence, not burnout.

**Breakdown:**

* **4 hours make** — Deep work on editing/creating
* **2 hours move** — Exercise, fitness, martial arts
* **1 hour prep** — Planning, admin, preparation

**Enemy:** Hustle Bros (glorifying 12-hour days)

## Core Four™

**What it is:** The four fundamentals that make videos feel right.

**The four:**

* Pacing
* Music
* Visuals
* Design

**In practice:** Master these before adding effects or flash.

## The Word-of-Work™ Method

**What it is:** Using existing work to attract new clients. Your portfolio does the selling.

**In practice:** Post your best work on Twitter/X. Let the work speak for itself. Quality attracts quality clients.

**Enemy:** Funnel Bros (over-engineered systems instead of portfolio)

## Quality over Quantity

**What it is:** 5 videos at $1K beats 25 videos at $200. Better clients, not more clients.

**In practice:** Focus on fewer, higher-paying clients rather than volume. Build depth, not breadth.

# Section 2: Strategic Frameworks

## Twist & Stick™

**What it is:** The two phases of scaling as a video editor.

### Phase 1: Twist

* Client-hopping phase
* Raising prices by jumping clients ($200 → $300 → $500/video)
* Learning fast, not committing long-term
* Building portfolio and skills
* **Purpose:** Gain experience, raise baseline rates

### Phase 2: Stick

* Going all-in on one client
* Building leverage through depth
* Becoming irreplaceable
* **Purpose:** Build leverage, command premium rates

### When to Switch (The Signal)

When you find a client where YOUR SKILL is the bottleneck, not their budget.

**Signs of a Stick client:**

* Agrees to price easily (no negotiation)
* Has real budget
* Content you enjoy editing
* Sees potential in you

**The ceiling:** Twist has a ceiling around $2-3K/month. Beyond that requires Stick.

## The Three S's™

**What it is:** What premium clients actually pay for.

### Story

* Creating the viewer experience
* Making people feel something
* Pacing, music selection, emotional arc
* "What does the viewer want to see?" not "what looks cool?"

### Style

* Adapting to the client's specific format and audience
* NOT imposing your own style
* Thinking from first principles
* Becoming a specialist in their videos

### Schedule

* Hitting deadlines consistently
* No drama, no excuses
* **Most important for clients with real businesses**
* "90% on time > 100% late"

### Key Insight

High-paying clients aren't paying for more views. They're paying for someone who makes their life easier — someone who just gets it.

## Volume Path vs. Leverage Path

**What it is:** The two ways editors try to scale (one works, one has a ceiling).

### Volume Path (Ceiling at $2-3K/month)

* More clients
* More videos
* Faster editing
* More hours

**Problem:** Zero leverage. Can be replaced by two slower editors.

### Leverage Path (No ceiling)

* Fewer clients, more depth
* Becoming irreplaceable
* Mastering one client's format
* Building relationships

**Result:** Premium rates, less work, more fulfillment.

# Section 3: Tactical Frameworks

## Premium Positioning Protocol™

**What it is:** System for positioning yourself to attract premium clients.

**Components:**

* X/Twitter profile optimization
* Portfolio curation (3 great videos > 15 mediocre ones)
* Content that demonstrates expertise
* Inbound over outreach

## High-Ticket Outreach™

**What it is:** Quality over quantity, personalized not automated.

**Principles:**

* Research the creator before reaching out
* Personalized messages, not templates
* Show you understand their content
* Lead with value

## Texts to Thousands™

**What it is:** Closing high-paying clients over DMs without sales calls.

**Key insight:** Artem has never taken a sales call to close a client. All closed via DM.

## The Editing Hierarchy™

**What it is:** The order of operations for editing.

**The hierarchy:**

1. **Structure** — Story blocks, sections, overall arc
2. **Flow** — Pacing, transitions, rhythm
3. **Clarity** — Graphics, text, digestibility
4. **Polish** — SFX, effects, animations

**Key insight:** Most editors start at Polish. Start at Structure.

## The VX™ Workflow

**What it is:** The progressive cut system.

**Versions:**

* **V0** — Rough assembly, structure only
* **V1** — First complete draft
* **V2** — Revised based on feedback
* **V3+** — Further iterations as needed

## Story Blocks™

**What it is:** Sections/chapters of a video used for pacing.

**In practice:** Break videos into distinct sections with clear purposes. Each block serves the overall story.

## Base File™

**What it is:** Reusable Premiere/AE project with client assets.

**Contains:**

* Client's fonts
* Color presets
* Commonly used graphics
* Audio presets

**Purpose:** Faster editing, consistent style across videos.

## Powerful Phrases™

**What it is:** Technique for improving pacing by using impactful language at key moments.

## Story Proof™

**What it is:** Showing real proof on screen (screenshots, actual websites, real footage) rather than just talking about it.

**In practice:** Don't say "I got a client" — show the DM. Don't say "I made $10K" — show the invoice.

# Section 4: Concepts (Not Branded)

## The Cheat Code (Revisions)

**What it is:** Treating revisions as free coaching instead of annoyance.

**The analogy:**

```
You're in a math exam. You haven't prepared. Your friend slips you a cheat sheet — not just the answers, but the full solutions.

Most editors copy the final answer and throw away the sheet.

The editors who level up study the solutions. They find the patterns. Eventually, they don't need the cheat sheet anymore.
```

**Key behavior:** Don't just make the change. Ask WHY the client wanted this change. Find the pattern.

## 90% On Time > 100% Late

**What it is:** The principle that reliability beats perfection for high-paying clients.

**Why:** Their posting schedule affects views, customers, revenue. They'd rather have good-enough on time than perfect late.

## The Signal

**What it is:** How you know you've found a Stick client.

**The signal:** They agree to your price easily. No negotiation. No pushback.

**What it means:** Their budget isn't the constraint. Your skill is. They'd pay more if you were better.

# Section 5: Enemy Language

## Sparkle Syndrome™

**What it is:** Adding effects for their sake. Braindead flashy editing that looks impressive but feels empty.

**The problem:** Effects that don't serve the story. Building houses with no foundation.

## Funnel Bros

**What it is:** Editors who build complex VSL funnels instead of a simple portfolio.

**The alternative:** You don't need a 47-step funnel. You need 3 great videos and a clean profile.

## Hustle Bros

**What it is:** Glorifying working as much as possible. The 12-hour myth. Burnout as a badge of honor.

**The alternative:** 4 hours of deep work beats 12 hours of scattered grinding.

## Bedroom Editor (Syndrome)

**What it is:** No life outside the timeline. No gym, no friends, no hobbies. Work and life merged into one blob.

**The alternative:** The 4-2-1™ Rule. Work-life separation, not balance.

## Agency Bros

**What it is:** Scaling through volume and hiring. Grinding 50+ videos/month.

**The alternative:** Quality over quantity. 1-2 premium clients at $2K+/video.
