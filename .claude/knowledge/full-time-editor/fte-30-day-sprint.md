# **FULL-TIME EDITOR™ 30-DAY SPRINT OVERVIEW**

The Gateway Experience for Skilled-But-Stuck Editors Ready to Break Through

---

# **Section 1: Who This Is For**

## **You're Not a Beginner**

You know how to edit. You have clients. You're making *some* money.

But you've been stuck at $1-2K/month for months (maybe over a year), and you're starting to wonder if this is all there is.

```
"I think that I don't have a problem, but I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem."

"For the past one year, I'm currently stuck on $1K per month. The highest I had was $1.8K."
```

You're working 40-60 hours a week. Your effective hourly rate is probably $5-15/hour, but you try not to think about that.

You have 1-3 clients. Maybe one "main" client that makes you nervous because if they dropped you, you'd be at zero.

## **The Real Problem**

**What You Think The Problem Is:**
- "I need more clients"
- "I need to improve my editing"
- "I need better luck"

**What The ACTUAL Problem Is:**
- No positioning: you're a generalist in a specialist's game
- No storytelling fundamentals: compensating with effects (`Sparkle Syndrome™`)
- No confidence framework: can't justify premium prices
- No client acquisition system: hoping for inbound without a brand

You have the mechanical skills. You're missing the storytelling fundamentals that make videos *feel* right. And you're missing the clarity on what's actually holding you back.

## **Why You Haven't Joined Full-Time Editor Yet**

Let's be honest:

- **"It's a big commitment"** - 4 months, $3K. You're not sure if it's right for you.
- **"I don't know if I need mentorship"** - Maybe you can figure this out on your own?
- **"What if it doesn't work for me?"** - You've tried courses before. They didn't stick.
- **"I'm not ready"** - You want to get a bit further first.

Here's the truth: You're ready. You just need proof that this approach works for YOU specifically.

**That's what the 30-Day Sprint is for.**

---

# **Section 2: What The 30-Day Sprint Is**

## **The Core Idea**

The 30-Day Sprint is a **compressed, high-intensity version** of the first month of Full-Time Editor.

**It's NOT:**
- A watered-down course
- Generic modules you watch alone
- A "lite" version with less value

**It IS:**
- Month 1 of the full program, delivered in 30 days
- Real mentorship, real feedback, real results
- A test drive to see if Full-Time Editor is right for you

## **What You Get**

### **1. 30-Minute Personalized Onboarding Call**

We get on a call within your first week. I review your application, your current work, and your goals.

Then I build you a **custom 30-day roadmap**:
- What's holding you back right now
- Your biggest skill gap
- Your focus for the next 30 days
- Specific action items

This isn't a sales call. This is a diagnostic session where I tell you exactly what you need to work on.

```
"I've never had this kind of attitude to me. People were always just giving me these answers that are just for the general people who are editing, not especially for me."
```

### **2. Four Weekly Editing Reviews**

Every week, you submit your actual editing work. You get a personalized Loom from me with frame-by-frame feedback.

**Not generic advice. YOUR specific gaps.**

```
"The reviews of the videos really helped me. You saying how I'm always defaulting to a style. And then I made the next videos and those were viral Twitter videos. That was the biggest thing."
```

**Week 1:** Diagnostic review - I identify your patterns, strengths, and gaps  
**Week 2:** Focused feedback on one Core Four element (pacing, music, visuals, or design)  
**Week 3:** Advanced technique implementation  
**Week 4:** Progress check - how far you've come in 30 days

### **3. Full Curriculum Access**

You get immediate access to the entire Full-Time Editor curriculum:

**Pillar 1: $1K Videos**
- `Core Four™` - Pacing, Music, Visuals, Design
- `The Editing Hierarchy™` - Structure → Flow → Clarity → Polish
- `The VX™ Workflow` - Progressive cuts (V0, V1, V2)
- `Story Blocks™` - Sections for pacing
- `Powerful Phrases™` - Pacing through word emphasis
- `Story Proof™` - Real proof on screen
- `Base File™` - Reusable project assets

**Pillar 2: Elite Brand**
- Specialist positioning
- X/Twitter profile optimization
- Portfolio curation
- `The Word-of-Work™ Method`

**Pillar 3: Client Flow**
- Content strategy for inbound
- `High-Ticket Outreach™`
- `Texts to Thousands™` - Close via DM
- Pricing with confidence

**You get everything.** No "Phase 1 only" restrictions. Full access for 30 days.

### **4. All Group Calls (4x Per Week)**

You're not in a separate "sprint tier." You join the actual Full-Time Editor group calls:

- **1x Weekly Masterclass** - I teach a topic, you implement
- **1x Weekly Review** - Group progress check and action items
- **2x Weekly Group Coaching Calls** - Bring any question, get it answered

```
"The main thing inside the program for me was the group calls. Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video. Having those group calls quite a few times a week with the boys inside the program: they're all legends. It gets you in a good mood again and lights the fire back in you."
```

### **5. Community Access**

Full access to the Full-Time Editor community:
- Editors already earning $5-10K/month
- Editors on the same journey as you
- Real-time feedback, client referrals, accountability

```
"The guys in the community are so nice. The group calls literally made my day."
```

## **Week 1: Diagnostic**

**Your First Week:**
- Onboarding call scheduled and completed
- You receive your personalized 30-day roadmap
- You submit your first edit for review
- You attend your first group calls

**Expected Outcome:**

**Expected Outcome:**
- Measurable skill improvement
- Clarity on whether you want to continue
- If yes: seamless transition to the full 4-month program

---

# **Section 4: What Makes This Different**

## **Not a Course. Mentorship.**

Other programs give you videos to watch and hope you figure it out.

The 30-Day Sprint gives you:
- Direct feedback on YOUR work
- Personalized roadmap for YOUR situation
- Real-time support in group calls
- Community of editors at YOUR level

## **Not Beginner Content. Advanced.**

This isn't "how to use Premiere Pro." You already know the tools.

This is:
- Why your edits don't feel premium (even though they're technically good)
- What storytelling fundamentals you're missing
- How to position yourself to attract $1K/video clients

## **Not Generic. Niche-Specific.**

```
"Your courses are directly made on business and talking head videos, which is perfect. You learn so much from someone who is directly in your niche."
```

If you edit business content, talking heads, YouTube videos, or similar formats, this is built for you.

## **Still In The Arena**

I'm not a retired guru. I recently lived this exact journey (stuck at $1-2K/month, broke through to $5-10K/month).

I still edit for premium clients. I know what works NOW, not what worked 5 years ago.

---

# **Section 5: The Two Paths After 30 Days**

## **Path 1: Continue to the Full Program**

If the 30-Day Sprint proves that Full-Time Editor works for you, you can seamlessly continue.

**What Happens:**
- Your $499 sprint payment counts toward the full $3K program
- You pay the remaining $2,501 to continue for Months 2-4
- No re-onboarding needed - you just keep going
- Custom roadmap for your next 90 days based on Month 1 progress

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- You've already experienced the teaching style
- You've seen real improvement in 30 days
- You know the community and group calls work for you
- You're bought into the process

**Expected Conversion Rate:** 50% of Sprint participants continue to the full program.

## **Path 2: Take What You Learned and Go**

If after 30 days you decide the full program isn't for you, that's completely fine.

**What You Walk Away With:**
- 4 personalized editing reviews with specific feedback
- Full curriculum access (you keep your notes and implementations)
- 30 days of group call insights
- Community connections and potential client referrals
- Clarity on what you need to work on next

**You're NOT locked in.** The Sprint is designed to be valuable standalone OR as a gateway to the full program.

---

# **Section 6: The Investment**

## **The Numbers**

**Investment:** $499  
**Duration:** 30 days  
**Capacity:** 15 spots per cohort (limited)

## **What $499 Gets You**

- 30-minute personalized onboarding call and roadmap
- 4 weekly editing reviews (personalized Loom feedback)
- Full curriculum access for 30 days
- 4x per week group calls (16 total calls)
- Community access for 30 days
- Option to continue to full program (with $499 credit applied)

## **The ROI**

If you land ONE $1K/video client as a result of the Sprint, it pays for itself 2x over.

If you continue to the full program and hit $5K/month, the entire investment ($3K total) pays for itself in the first month of that income level.

## **Why Not Just Join the Full Program?**

Valid question. Here's the honest answer:

**Join the Full Program ($3K) if:**
- You're 100% committed to getting to $5-10K/month
- You're ready to invest 4 months
- You don't need to "test drive" first

**Join the 30-Day Sprint ($499) if:**
- You want to experience the program before committing long-term
- You're not sure if personalized mentorship is worth it for you
- You want proof that this approach works for YOUR specific situation
- You're hesitant about the $3K investment without seeing results first

**The Sprint is the "try before you buy" option.**

---

# **Section 7: How It Works**

## **Step 1: Apply**

Fill out the application (5 minutes):
- Current income level
- Type of content you edit
- Biggest challenge right now
- What you want to achieve in 30 days

## **Step 2: Review**

I personally review every application. If you're a fit, you'll get a payment link.

**This is NOT first-come-first-served.** I'm selecting 15 people who:
- Are actually stuck (not beginners)
- Are coachable (willing to implement feedback)
- Edit content in my niche (business, talking heads, YouTube)

## **Step 3: Payment & Access**

Once you pay, you immediately get:
- Skool community access
- Slack invite
- Full curriculum access
- Calendar link to book your onboarding call

## **Step 4: Onboarding Call (Week 1)**

We get on a 30-minute call. I review your work, ask questions, and build your custom roadmap.

You walk away knowing:
- Your biggest gap
- Your 30-day focus
- What to submit for your first edit review

## **Step 5: The Sprint Begins**

For the next 30 days:
- Submit weekly edits
- Attend group calls
- Implement feedback
- Engage with the community
- Consume the curriculum at your own pace

## **Step 6: Week 4 Decision**

At the end of 30 days, you decide:
- Continue to the full program (pay $2,501 for Months 2-4)
- OR walk away with what you've learned

**No pressure. No hard sell. Your choice.**

---

# **Section 8: Who This Is NOT For**

## **Don't Join If:**

- **You're a complete beginner** - This is for editors already making $1-2K/month. If you don't know editing software, start with beginner courses.
- **You've never been paid to edit** - You need baseline client experience first.
- **You want passive learning** - This requires submitting work and implementing feedback. If you just want to watch videos, buy a course.
- **You won't submit edits for review** - The whole point is personalized feedback. If you won't submit work, don't join.
- **You're looking for "easy money"** - This is skill-building, not a get-rich-quick scheme.
- **You edit outside my niche** - If you edit music videos, narrative films, or highly stylized content, my feedback may not be as relevant.

---

# **Section 9: Common Questions**

## **"What if I can't attend all the group calls?"**

Calls are recorded. You can watch replays. But live attendance is encouraged—that's where the real value is.

## **"What if I don't improve in 30 days?"**

If you show up, submit work, and implement feedback, you WILL improve. It's not a question of "if," it's a question of "how much."

If you ghost, don't submit edits, and skip calls, nothing will change. The program doesn't fail—you have to actually participate.

## **"Can I get a refund if it's not for me?"**

No refunds. You're paying for access, feedback, and mentorship. Once you're in, you're in.

That said, if you show up and engage, the value will be there. This isn't a course you buy and forget about.

## **"What happens after 30 days if I don't continue?"**

You lose access to the community, group calls, and curriculum. But you keep:
- All your personalized Loom feedback (saved in your email)
- All your notes from the curriculum
- Connections you made in the community

## **"How is this different from the full program?"**

It's not different—it's the SAME program, just Month 1 only.

The full program gives you Months 2-4, which include:
- Deeper skill refinement
- Advanced positioning and branding work
- Client acquisition systems
- Ongoing accountability for 4 months total

The Sprint is Month 1 standalone.

## **"If I continue to the full program, do I pay the full $3K?"**

No. You pay $3K total. Since you already paid $499 for the Sprint, you'd pay $2,501 to continue.

**Breakdown:**
- Sprint: $499
- Continue to full program: $2,501
- **Total: $3,000**

## **"Why only 15 spots?"**

I personally review every edit submission and onboard every student. 15 people per cohort is my capacity limit while maintaining quality.

I'd rather have 15 students getting real results than 50 students getting generic feedback.

## **"When does the next cohort start?"**

Cohorts launch every 4-6 weeks. If this one fills up, you can join the waitlist for the next launch.

---

# **Section 10: Real Results (From Full Program Students)**

## **These Are NOT Sprint Results - These Are Full Program Results**

The Sprint is Month 1 of this journey. Here's what's possible if you continue:

### **Taylor (UK): $1K/Week Client**

```
"I posted a re-edit on Twitter. End of the day, it was 140 likes. I was getting a ton of inbounds."

"The 1st of January, new year, first day of the new year, I got a DM from Stan. A YouTuber with 11 million subscribers."

"It was $1K a week. So basically a $4K a month job."
```

### **Kimi (Germany, 17): €2,000/Video**

```
"I'm charging him a fat €2,000 per vlog."

"Now I'm getting inbounds that are paying €800 or €1K for a video."

"I'm not as stressed anymore, which is actually a huge thing for me."
```

**These results took 4 months, not 30 days.** But the Sprint is where their transformation started.

---

# **Section 11: What The Sprint Actually Tests**

## **For You:**

The Sprint tests whether:
- Personalized mentorship actually helps you (vs. generic courses)
- My teaching style resonates with you
- The community and group calls are valuable
- You're willing to implement feedback (vs. just consume content)
- The investment is worth it for your situation

## **For Me:**

The Sprint tests whether:
- You're coachable (do you implement feedback or ignore it?)
- You're committed (do you show up or ghost?)
- You're a culture fit for the community
- You're ready for the full program (or need more time)

**It's a two-way evaluation.** I'm not just selling you access. I'm assessing if you're a fit for the long-term program.

---

# **Section 12: The Honest Truth**

## **This Won't Work If:**

- You don't submit edits for review
- You skip the onboarding call
- You don't implement feedback
- You ghost the group calls
- You expect results without effort

## **This WILL Work If:**

- You show up to calls
- You submit your work (even if it's not perfect)
- You implement the feedback I give you
- You engage with the community
- You're willing to be uncomfortable (hearing honest feedback about your gaps)

```
The program doesn't fail.

But if you join and ghost, nothing happens.
```

---

# **Section 13: Why I'm Offering This**

## **The Honest Reason**

I used to only sell the full $3K program. And I noticed a pattern:

**Some people wanted to join but were hesitant:**
- "I'm not sure if mentorship is worth it"
- "I don't know if this will work for ME"
- "It's a big commitment"

These were smart, valid concerns. And I realized: **they just need proof.**

The 30-Day Sprint is that proof.

**It's not a cash grab.** If it were, I'd let in 100 people and automate everything. Instead, I'm capping it at 15 and personally onboarding and reviewing everyone.

**It's a win-win:**
- You get to test the program without committing 4 months and $3K upfront
- I get to work with people who are genuinely committed (the ones who continue)

---

# **Section 14: The Decision**

## **You're At a Fork**

**Path 1: Keep Doing What You're Doing**
- Stay stuck at $1-2K/month
- Keep hoping clients will magically value your work more
- Keep wondering what you're missing

**Path 2: Take 30 Days and Find Out**
- Get personalized feedback on your actual work
- See if mentorship actually moves the needle for you
- Walk away with clarity (either continue to full program OR know exactly what to work on next)

```
What happens if we literally have the same exact conversation half a year later and you're in the same position?
```

**You've been stuck for how long? 6 months? A year?**

**What's 30 days to find out what's actually holding you back?**

---

# **Section 15: How to Join**

## **Step 1: Apply**

[Application Link]

Fill out the form. 5 minutes.

## **Step 2: Wait for Review**

I'll review your application within 24-48 hours. If you're a fit, you'll get a payment link.

## **Step 3: Secure Your Spot**

Only 15 spots available. First-qualified, first-served (not first-come).

## **Step 4: Onboarding Begins**

Once you pay, you're in. Onboarding call scheduled within the first week.

---

# **Final Word**

You're not a beginner. You know how to edit.

But you're stuck, and you know it.

The gap between where you are ($1-2K/month) and where you want to be ($5-10K/month) isn't as big as you think.

**But you don't have to figure it out alone.**

30 days. $499. 15 spots.

Find out what's actually holding you back.

```
Storytelling First™. Always.

Top 1% Editing. Full-Time Income. Freedom Lifestyle.
