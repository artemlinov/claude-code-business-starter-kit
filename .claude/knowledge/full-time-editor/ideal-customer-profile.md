# FTE™ IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE

The Skilled-But-Stuck Video Editor: Understanding Your Prospect Better Than They Understand Themselves

---

# Section 1: The Core Avatar

## The Customer in 50 Words

They're not beginners. They know how to edit. They have clients. They're making *some* money. But they're trapped in what feels like quicksand: the more they work, the more exhausted they get, and yet the income needle barely moves. They look at editors charging $1K/video and think: "I could do that... but I don't know what I'm missing."

## The Identity: "Skilled But Stuck"

This is the defining characteristic. They have demonstrable skills, consistent clients, and a track record of delivering. Yet they're earning part-time wages for full-time hours. The frustration comes from the gap between their effort and their income.

```
"I think that I don't have a problem, but I'm stuck at the same point for quite a while. So obviously there is a problem."

"I know that my position could be so much more, but I'm lukewarm. My story is not evolving."

"I'm stuck at $1K for the past one years."
```

**What Makes Them Different From Beginners:**

* They've moved past the "how do I find my first client" stage
* They understand the basics of editing (cuts, effects, workflow)
* They've experienced both good months and bad months
* They have social proof (even if limited)
* They know quality matters, they just can't translate it to income

**What Makes Them Different From Successful Editors:**

* They charge $200-500/video instead of $1,000+
* They take any client instead of choosing ideal fits
* They optimize for hours worked instead of value delivered
* They lack a systematic approach to client acquisition
* They don't understand storytelling as the core differentiator

# Section 2: Demographics

## Age & Gender

* **Primary:** 17-25 years old
* **Gender:** Predominantly male (85%+), some females
* **Sweet Spot:** 18-22 (old enough to take seriously, young enough to have low expenses)

## Geographic Distribution

**Primary Markets:**

* Eastern Europe (Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Poland)
* Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico)
* South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan)
* Southeast Asia (Philippines, Indonesia)

**Secondary Markets:**

* Western Europe (UK, Portugal, Germany)
* North America (USA, Canada)
* Middle East (UAE, Saudi Arabia)

**Geographic Insight:** Location significantly impacts money psychology. A Bulgarian editor sees $3K/month as "a lot" while a US editor sees it as barely surviving.

## Income Profile

**Current State:**

* Monthly income: $1,000-2,500
* Per video rate: $150-500
* Hours worked: 40-60/week
* Effective hourly rate: $5-15/hour

**The Income Ceiling:**

```
"For the past one year, I'm currently stuck on $1K per month. The highest I had was $1.8K."

"I'm still kind of a $2K to $3K a month person. It kind of sucks."

"$1.5K/month is a retainer, it's a good retainer. But if he drops me off, I'm at point zero."
```

## Living Situation

**Most Common:**

* Living with parents (60%+)
* Shared apartments with friends/roommates
* Modest solo rentals in low cost-of-living areas

**Why This Matters:**

Living with parents creates the "Comfort Zone Trap": expenses are low enough to survive on $1-2K/month, which removes the urgency to grow. But it also creates the perfect investment window, they have runway to take risks.

```
"I'm still staying with my parents too. So I don't have crazy expenses. It just feels like everything is there right now, in case anything fails."
```

## Education & Background

**Formal Education:**

* Often studying unrelated subjects (economics, engineering, "whatever's easy")
* Many dropped out or are considering dropping out
* University seen as "something to show family" rather than career path

```
"The colleges here are not very good. The degrees I will get from colleges around here will not be of any use. Literally not of any use."

"It's peer pressure, family stuff. I'm going to economics class. It's the easiest one there. So it's just to show family that I go to university and that's it."
```

**Editing Education:**

* Self-taught through YouTube tutorials
* Learned as hobby in teens, turned professional
* May have taken 1-2 courses (often disappointed by them)
* Never had personalized mentorship

## Client Profile

**Current Clients:**

* 1-3 active clients (usually 1 "main" client)
* Mix of YouTubers, coaches, small agencies
* Often found through luck, referrals, or platforms
* Relationships feel fragile and replaceable

```
"I didn't really know how to get clients. I had clients mainly mostly because of just luck. I was kind of holding on to that."

"Right now I basically have one consistent client and that's it. And it's very scary, always thinking about next month."
```

# Section 3: Psychographics

## The Quality Over Quantity Identity

This is a core identity marker. They genuinely believe in doing great work, not just fast work. They see themselves as artists, not assembly line workers. This belief is both their strength and their limitation.

```
"I'm more of a quality over quantity guy. Yeah, definitely."

"Even if I have two clients that pay me $2K a video, I need to be putting my soul into the video to be worth it."

"I want to focus on quality because I want to be a better editor too. Not just making a lot of money."
```

**The Paradox:** They believe in quality but accept quantity-level pay. They overdeliver for clients but undercharge for their work.

## The Accountability Paradox (Key Discovery)

This insight explains why courses fail but mentorship works. They have extraordinary discipline for client work but zero discipline for their own growth.

```
"When I need to get a video done, I instantly sat down the next day at 6am and started editing and wanted to finish as fast as I can so I can please my client the best. But when it actually comes down to helping myself with outreaching, I just procrastinated on it for days."

"I'm just the kind of person who when has to do things for himself, I usually procrastinate on. When there's someone holding my hand or someone I have to do things for, then I'm much more likely to work harder."
```

**Translation:** They'll wake up at 2am with a fever to ship a client video. But they'll procrastinate indefinitely on outreach, portfolio updates, or skill development. The comfort zone trap isn't laziness. It's the absence of external deadlines for needle-moving activities.

**Why This Matters for Sales:** They don't need more information. They need accountability. This is why courses alone don't work.

## The Loneliness Pain Point

Editing is isolating by nature. They spend 8-12 hours alone behind a laptop. This loneliness amplifies other problems and makes community disproportionately valuable.

```
"Editing is very lonely sometimes. You're just on your own behind your laptop all day grinding on a video. Sometimes there's not much social life outside of it when you are locked in."

"I don't really talk to other editors."
```

**Why This Matters:** Group calls and community aren't just "nice to have." They're solving a deep, often unstated need for connection with people who understand the struggle.

## The 9-to-5 Escape Desperation

Many come from or are fleeing traditional employment. The hatred of conventional work is visceral and deeply motivating.

```
"I worked in a warehouse in the freezer, literal minus 27 degrees every day."

"I've always just hated authority. Not police, but in terms of back in school I hated listening to teachers tell me what to do."

"I don't want to be stuck in one place. You can't travel wherever you want, you can't live wherever you want. Even if you do earn a lot of money, you can't really spend it."

"I kind of got to the point where it was like, okay, I'm gonna get rich or die trying. Because I'm not doing this for the rest of my fucking life."
```

**The Fear:** Having to go back to a "real job" is their nightmare scenario. Editing failing means returning to the freezer warehouse, the toxic manager, the soul-crushing routine.

## The Respect Craving

Beyond money, they want to be treated as creative partners, not replaceable vendors. Bad client experiences have taught them that money without respect is still misery.

```
"Nowadays this is straight up non-negotiable. I don't care what the pay is. If the client is a dickhead and I hate working for him every single day, I don't care, I'm not gonna work for him."

"When you have a client who is disrespectful, they kind of treat you like they're your boss. And I hate that."

"I'm not creative if I hate what I'm doing. If I hate the work I'm doing, I can't sit down and just do a really good job because, truthfully, I don't really want to."

"It feels like we're easily replaced. The goal of the editor is to become irreplaceable."
```

## The Provider Motivation

For many, the "why" isn't personal wealth. It's providing for someone they love, proving to family that freelancing works, or building something they can be proud of.

```
"My girlfriend is starting vet school next year. I want to be making $7-10K/month so she can fully commit to vet school without working a job."

"Being able to provide for my girlfriend is going to be amazing."

"I really want to give my girlfriend a trip to Madeira. She's spamming me every single week with TikToks and reels about Madeira."

"All the jobs I've worked in past I got in from a relative or a friend. Video editing, how far I take it is all on me. It's a little bit of a pride thing: seeing if I could really take it to $100K a year."
```

## The Imposter Syndrome Loop

Despite demonstrable skills, they constantly doubt their worth. They compare themselves to elite editors on Twitter and conclude they're not good enough.

```
"I sometimes think that maybe I'm not even that good for that kind of money. Because sometimes I think that people work with me only because I'm always on time. But it's not about a good video. It's about video on time."

"I'm always skeptical. There's always... in my editing, it could always be better."

"Maybe kind of in a way more professional looking. I don't think I'm there yet, but maybe I am, and I'm just putting myself down. I don't know."
```

# Section 4: The Pain Landscape

## Surface-Level Pains (What They Initially Mention)

**Income Frustration:**

```
"For the past one year, I'm currently stuck on $1K per month."

"I've been stuck at this stage for six months at this point."

"Last year, there was a month I made €100. It was absolutely awful."
```

**Client Acquisition Struggles:**

```
"I was getting ghosted by almost 90% of the people I outreached."

"I tried outreach. I was sending 300 to 400 emails per day. None of them really converted to good clients."

"The only thing I tried was posting on X but my posts were flopping hard, getting 100 impressions."
```

**Feeling Stuck:**

```
"I've been editing since March and I've just kind of stayed at a stale income between $600 to $900."

"It was a bit discouraging because I felt like I was just hitting my head on a brick wall."

"Everything needed to change. Everything."
```

## Deeper Pains (What They Reveal Later)

**Anxiety & Emotional Weight:**

```
"I'm desperate. My situation right now... you know what it is to go to bed and thinking about all this stuff, all of it, anxiety, waking up in the morning, the same thing. It's fucking routine."

"It feels like I'm stuck to the desk. Like I'm chained to the desk every day. I don't reap the rewards from being at the desk that much. That's why it just feels like torture sometimes."

"My mental state comes and goes."
```

**Financial Stress Impact on Health:**

```
"Before, like January, December, November, I was always really stressed because I knew that the clients could always just stop working with me. I was incredibly stressed. Really stressed."

"My watch in the Discord always sent things like, 'okay, today, high stress zone, two hours.' And everyone was making fun of me."

"I tracked my sleep. Only 2-3 days hit seven hours. Averaging 4-5 hours. Taking a toll on all aspects of my life."
```

**Life Setbacks Compounding:**

```
"This last year I made quite a lot less money than the previous year. I made €10K less from one year to the other and it's quite depressing."

"I had a girlfriend for two years that I really committed to the relationship and I just had to break up with her in June and I'm still struggling with it."

"I also lost my grandfather last year. So it was a piece of shit year. This year has to be better."
```

**Family Pressure:**

```
"My dad thinks that I'm wasting my time and I should go and help him. He thinks that I need to go to the army so I'm more disciplined."

"The biggest boundary was actually making my parents understand that I actually am doing something important and that they shouldn't bother me."

"When you start out with any business, people are not gonna respect you for it because they can't see any results."
```

## The Hidden Pain: Not Knowing What They Don't Know

They sense something is missing but can't name it. The phrase "I don't know what I'm missing" appears repeatedly.

```
"I watch these top editors and think... I could do that, but I don't know what I'm missing."

"A lot of people told me that when I tell them the prices I charge, people are quite shocked because they think I can make more. And I kinda agree. But there's still something I'm missing if I'm not there."
```

**What They Think the Problem Is:**

* "I need more clients"
* "I need to improve my editing"
* "I need to work harder"
* "I need better luck"

**What the ACTUAL Problem Is:**

* No positioning: they're generalists in a specialist's game
* No storytelling fundamentals: compensating with effects (Sparkle Syndrome™)
* No confidence framework: can't justify premium prices
* No client acquisition system: hoping for inbound without a brand
* No accountability: procrastinating on growth while meeting client deadlines

# Section 5: The Desire Landscape

## Immediate Desires (What They Say First)

**Income Goals:**

```
"$5K per month for now, realistically."

"Probably $3K a month is the point where I would feel comfortable. But if we take everything to the stars, I would like to make like $5K a month from editing."

"$7-10K/month so my girlfriend can fully commit to vet school."
```

**Client Quality:**

```
"My dream scenario is working with clients that actually make you improve your editing. High paying clients that have good, high expectations."

"Premium clients that pay $1K per video."
```

## Deeper Desires (The Emotional Core)

**Freedom From Financial Stress:**

```
"I just want to cover my costs with a bit left over."

"My goal has always just been to do what I love and be able to live off of it and not have to ever really worry about money."

"I want to have that amount of money to be independent and financially free."

"I have all this weight on my shoulders right now. If I hit that amount of money, I would be more relaxed, less anxiety and life would be better."
```

**The Real Dream: Location Freedom & Lifestyle:**

```
"I'm from the UK, but mate, I don't want to go back home. Since I've been out here in Thailand, I just... this is how I want to live."

"My job was I was stuck in a warehouse working in a freezer, minus 27 degrees every day. And I was like, damn bro, people are making money online and living in Thailand and living a good life. I need to sort my shit out."

"It sucks a lot to live in a split bedroom with my brother."

"When I make €4-5K a month, obviously I can actually have cash now. Full blown cash and I can actually live properly."
```

**Respect & Creative Partnership:**

```
"I want clients to value my work, not just hire the cheapest option."

"I want to be seen as a premium editor, not just another freelancer."

"I want to work with creators I actually respect."
```

**Proving Themselves:**

```
"All the jobs I've worked in past I got in from a relative or a friend. Video editing, how far I take it is all on me. It's a little bit of a pride thing."

"It's not even proving your family wrong, but just proving yourself that you are self dependent."
```

## The Identity Transformation They're Seeking

**From → To:**

* From "Just Editing" → "Building My Future"
* From "Current Me" → "Future Successful Me"
* From "Stuck/Directionless" → "Taking Action"
* From "Proving It to Others" → "Proving It to Myself"
* From "Isolated" → "Part of a Community"
* From "Replaceable" → "Irreplaceable"
* From "Bedroom Editor" → "Full-Time Editor™"

```
"All I can think about right now is just hitting that goal and proving myself. And fulfilling that identity that I have in my mind about the future me."
```

**The Central Truth:** Money is never the real goal. It's a proxy for identity transformation. They want to become someone who deserves respect: from clients, family, and most importantly, from themselves.

---

# Section 6: Behavioral Patterns

## Where They Spend Time Online

**Primary:**

* Twitter/X (following editors, consuming content, rarely posting due to imposter syndrome)
* YouTube (tutorials, vlogs, editing content)
* Discord communities for editors

**Secondary:**

* Upwork, YTjobs (looking for clients)
* Reddit (r/freelance, r/VideoEditing)
* Instagram (consuming, not creating)

**Pattern:** They consume far more than they create. They follow successful editors but feel intimidated to engage.

## Content They Consume

* Technical editing tutorials
* Success stories from other editors
* Business/freelancing advice for creatives
* Productivity and time management content
* X threads about video editing and rates

## Work Habits

**The "Locked In" Paradox:**

They describe themselves as extremely hardworking. But they optimize for input (hours worked) rather than output (videos completed, income generated).

```
"I average at least 50 hours per week and sometimes have to edit on the weekends."
```

**Perfectionism as Procrastination:**

They spend too long on details clients don't notice. "90% on time > 100% late" is foreign to them.

**Isolation:**

They work alone, rarely interact with other editors, and have no feedback loop on their work.

## The Procrastination Pattern

**What They DO:**

* Client work (reliably, even at 2am with fever)
* Consuming content about editing
* Tweaking details clients won't notice

**What They DON'T Do:**

* Outreach (procrastinate for days/weeks)
* Portfolio updates
* Posting their work on X
* Raising prices with existing clients
* Skill development outside client work

**Why:** No external accountability for growth activities. Client deadlines are real. Self-improvement deadlines are imaginary.

## Growth Attempts That Failed

```
"I tried outreach. I was sending 300 to 400 emails per day. None of them really converted."

"I had some previews to post on Twitter, but my reach is dead. So I'm scared to post them."

"Every other course I've taken is not advanced enough. They mostly take you from zero to a few grand a month. They can't really help you get to 8K-10K per month."

"It just says, yeah, post on Twitter. But I've been doing that for years now, and I'm at $3K-4K a month."
```

---

# Section 7: The Objection Landscape

## Spoken Objections

**Price/Affordability (Most Common):**

```
"I don't think I can do that. It's a bit much. I was actually thinking $1.1K, $1.2K, $1.5K. This is almost double."

"I don't even have $1.2K in my bank right now."

"If I had the money, I would directly pay that. No doubt. But with the money that I have right now, it's a bit difficult."
```

**Need to Consult Others:**

```
"My dad doesn't understand the online business space very much, but still it's a big investment for me. I think I need to talk to my parents before investing."
```

**Timing/Readiness:**

```
"Maybe next month because they pay me not per video but once a month."

"It's like one month of my salary, so... Yeah, I think I should give some time to think."
```

## Unspoken Objections

**Fear of Being Scammed:**

```
"Maybe it's because I have never invested in something like this before. So I have no idea if these things work or not."

"I was kind of skeptical because most of the times I've joined a community or a mentorship, it didn't really help me. I just wasted my money."
```

**Comfort Zone Defense:**

```
"I think the reason is actually I think that I can get to $5K by my own. I just wanted to join in to maybe have that boost."
```

**Previous Bad Experiences:**

```
"Coaches are scam. They just took my money and didn't really help me."

"It wasn't a personal connection. It was paying to have YouTube free videos inside a paid community."

"People were not really explaining why. They were just telling me stuff and not really trying to help me."
```

## What Overcomes Objections

**Pre-Sale Value:**

```
"You really helped me even before I was in the community. Even before I was in the program, on our call you helped me and I got instant results."
```

**Social Proof From Similar Backgrounds:**

```
"I've seen your videos and the people that interact with you: they seem that it has worked for them."

"To make it from 8 to 10 [confidence in program] is definitely me being able to see results. Some testimonials from guys that actually did it: that's a plus for me."
```

**Personalization:**

```
"I've never had this kind of attitude to me. People were always just giving me these answers that are just for the general people who are editing, not especially for me."

"The thing is that you are going in depth. You are going into depth and you will keep your focus on the pressure points."
```

**The "What If" Question (High-Converting):**

When asked "What happens if we literally have the same exact conversation six months from now and you're in the same position?", one prospect went silent for 10 seconds, then immediately asked for a payment plan.

---

# Section 8: Segmentation

## By Experience Level

**Newer Editors (1-2 years):**

* More focused on skill development
* Often working with one main client
* Still figuring out their niche
* Higher imposter syndrome
* Questions: "What is storytelling?" / "What do $1K videos look like?"

**More Experienced (3+ years):**

* Frustrated by rates declining despite skill growth
* More business-focused concerns
* Often tried multiple niches or approaches
* More cynical about the market ("rates going down")
* Burned out from overwork
* Already have skills: missing positioning and systems

## By Geographic/Cultural Background

**Eastern European/Latin American:**

* Stronger family financial pressure
* Parents often don't understand freelancing
* Lower local costs create different pricing psychology
* "$3K/month is a lot" mentality creates income ceiling
* Need to see someone from similar background succeed

**US/UK/Western:**

* More pressure to "move out" and be independent
* Higher cost of living creates more financial stress at $1-2K/month
* More likely to mention lifestyle goals (travel, location independence)
* Different relationship with money/investment

## By Living Situation

**Living With Parents:**

* Built-in safety net reduces urgency
* BUT also creates family pressure to "get a real job"
* Often need to prove freelancing is legitimate
* May offload accountability ("I need to talk to my parents first")
* Lower expenses = perfect timing window to invest

**Living Independently/With Partner:**

* Higher financial pressure = more urgency
* Provider motivation (for girlfriend, family)
* Risk tolerance often lower (can't afford to fail)
* More concrete "why" behind income goals

## By Motivation Type

**The Provider:**

Motivated by supporting someone else. Girlfriend, family, parents.

```
"$7-10K/month so my girlfriend can fully commit to vet school."
```

**The Escapee:**

Running from something (9-5, toxic job, controlling situation).

```
"I'm gonna get rich or die trying. I'm not doing this for the rest of my fucking life."
```

**The Prover:**

Needs to demonstrate success to themselves or others.

```
"It's a little bit of a pride thing: seeing if I could really take it to $100K a year."
```

**The Lifestyle Seeker:**

Dreams of location independence, travel, freedom.

```
"This is how I want to live. Asia, Thailand, Bali, those kind of places."
```

---

# Section 9: Decision-Making Psychology

## What Makes Them Say Yes

**1. Pre-Sale Value:**

Helping them on the sales call itself, before any commitment, builds massive trust.

**2. Proof From Similar Backgrounds:**

Seeing someone from Hungary, Bulgaria, or India hit $5K/month makes it feel possible.

**3. Personalization:**

Generic advice = scam. Specific advice tailored to their situation = trust.

**4. Community:**

```
"The guys in the community are so nice. The group calls literally made my day."

"Being with the community who is already earning $5K to $10K: it will be more motivating for me."
```

**5. The "What If" Question:**

"What happens if everything stays the same six months from now?" creates urgency without pressure.

**6. Clear Roadmap:**

```
"I want to get there with the systems. Because I know I'll be doing something that's proven to be right."
```

## What Makes Them Say No

* Generic, non-personalized advice
* No accountability or follow-up
* Feeling judged for their current situation
* "Need to talk to parents" (accountability offload)
* No emotional urgency created
* Already in another program
* Comfortable being stuck (frog in boiling water)

## Green Flags (Who Joins and Succeeds)

* Living with parents (low expenses, perfect timing window)
* Stuck 6+ months at same income (pent-up frustration)
* Strong family/relationship motivation
* Previous bad coaching experience (differentiation opportunity)
* Already consuming free content (pre-sold on approach)
* Quality over quantity mindset
* Asks specific questions (engaged, not passive)

## Red Flags (Who Doesn't Fit)

* Complete beginners with no clients
* Gaming/entertainment niche editors (different market)
* Those who just want to "see what's inside"
* Defending current situation instead of wanting change
* Blaming external factors exclusively
* No emotional response to future-state questions

# Section 11: The Transformation Journey

## Before State

* $1-2K/month income
* 40-60 hour weeks
* Constant stress about money
* Living with parents or barely surviving
* Checking prices before buying anything
* Isolated, no editor community
* Imposter syndrome despite skills
* Taking any client that comes along
* Scared to raise prices

## After State

* $5-10K/month income
* 2-3 premium clients paying $1K+/video
* 4-6 hour focused workdays (The 4-2-1™ Rule)
* Financial independence
* Building savings and investments
* Part of thriving editor community
* Confident in pricing conversations
* Choosing clients, not chasing them
* Recognized as creative partner, not vendor

## The Transformation They're Actually Buying

**Not just:** "$1K → $5K/month"

**Actually:** "Replaceable freelancer → Respected professional"

**Not just:** "More clients"

**Actually:** "Clients who value my work"

**Not just:** "Business tactics"

**Actually:** "The confidence to charge what I'm worth"

**Not just:** "Editing skills"

**Actually:** "Understanding that Storytelling First™ is the differentiator"

---

# Section 12: Competitive Positioning

## Why Other Programs Fail Them

```
"Every other course I've taken is not advanced enough. They mostly take you from zero to a few grand a month. They can't really help you get to 8K-10K per month."

"It just says, yeah, post on Twitter. But I've been doing that for years now."

"It wasn't a personal connection. It was paying to have YouTube free videos inside a paid community."
```

## What Makes FTE™ Different

**1. Advanced, Not Beginner:**

Other programs take you from 0 → $2K. FTE™ takes you from $1-2K → $5-10K. Different problem, different solution.

**2. Niche-Specific:**

```
"Your courses are directly made on business and talking head videos, which is perfect. You learn so much from someone who is directly in your niche."
```

**3. Personalized Accountability:**

Not generic course content. Actual feedback on their edits, their outreach, their situations.

**4. Still-In-The-Arena:**

Artem isn't a retired guru. He recently lived this exact journey. He still edits.

**5. Community of Similar Editors:**

# Section 13: Key Insights Summary

## The 5 Core Truths

**1. Money is a proxy for identity transformation.**

They don't just want $5K/month. They want to become someone worthy of respect.

**2. They need accountability, not information.**

They'll meet any client deadline but procrastinate indefinitely on their own growth.

**3. The skill gap is storytelling, not technical.**

They can do After Effects. They can't do pacing.

**4. Loneliness is an underrated pain point.**

Community and connection are more valuable than they initially realize.

**5. Previous coaching failures create both skepticism and opportunity.**

They've been burned before, but they're looking for something different.

## The Perfect Prospect

* 18-23 years old
* Making $1-2K/month editing talking head/business content
* Living with parents (low expenses, runway to invest)
* 6+ months stuck at current income level
* Has tried X posting, outreach, maybe a course, with limited results
* Strong "why" beyond money (girlfriend, family, escape)
* Quality over quantity mindset
* Already consuming Artem's free content
* Ready to be held accountable

## The Core Message That Resonates

"You're not a beginner anymore. You know how to edit. You have clients. But you're stuck, and you can feel it. The gap between where you are and $5-10K/month isn't as big as you think. It's not about working harder. It's about working differently. And you don't have to figure it out alone."
