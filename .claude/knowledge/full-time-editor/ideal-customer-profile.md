# FTE™ IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE

The Skilled-But-Stuck Video Editor: Understanding Your Prospect Better Than They Understand Themselves

---

# Section 1: The Core Avatar

## The Customer in 50 Words

They're not beginners. They know how to edit. They have clients. They're making *some* money. But they're trapped in what feels like quicksand: the more they work, the more exhausted they get, and yet the income needle barely moves. They look at editors charging $1K/video and think: "I could do that... but I don't know what I'm missing."

## The Identity: "Skilled But Stuck"

This is the defining characteristic. They have demonstrable skills, consistent clients, and a track record of delivering. Yet they're earning part-time wages for full-time hours.

**What Makes Them Different From Beginners:**

* They've moved past the "how do I find my first client" stage
* They understand the basics of editing (cuts, effects, workflow)
* They've experienced both good months and bad months
* They know quality matters, they just can't translate it to income

**What Makes Them Different From Successful Editors:**

* They charge $200-500/video instead of $1,000+
* They take any client instead of choosing ideal fits
* They optimize for hours worked instead of value delivered
* They lack a systematic approach to client acquisition
* They don't understand storytelling as the core differentiator

# Section 2: Demographics

## Age & Gender

* **Primary:** 17-25 years old
* **Gender:** Predominantly male (85%+)
* **Sweet Spot:** 18-22 (old enough to take seriously, young enough to have low expenses)

## Geographic Distribution

**Primary Markets:**

* Eastern Europe (Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Poland)
* Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico)
* South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan)
* Southeast Asia (Philippines, Indonesia)

**Secondary Markets:**

* Western Europe (UK, Portugal, Germany)
* North America (USA, Canada)
* Middle East (UAE, Saudi Arabia)

**Geographic Insight:** Location significantly impacts money psychology. A Bulgarian editor sees $3K/month as "a lot" while a US editor sees it as barely surviving.

## Income Profile

**Current State:**

* Monthly income: $1,000-2,500
* Per video rate: $150-500
* Hours worked: 40-60/week
* Effective hourly rate: $5-15/hour

## Living Situation

**Most Common:**

* Living with parents (60%+)
* Shared apartments with friends/roommates
* Modest solo rentals in low cost-of-living areas

Living with parents creates the "Comfort Zone Trap": expenses are low enough to survive on $1-2K/month, removing urgency to grow. But it also creates the perfect investment window.

## Education & Background

* Often studying unrelated subjects (economics, engineering, "whatever's easy")
* Many dropped out or are considering it
* University seen as "something to show family" rather than career path
* Self-taught through YouTube tutorials, never had personalized mentorship

## Client Profile

* 1-3 active clients (usually 1 "main" client)
* Mix of YouTubers, coaches, small agencies
* Often found through luck, referrals, or platforms
* Relationships feel fragile and replaceable

# Section 3: Psychographics

## Core Traits

**Quality Over Quantity Identity:** They genuinely believe in doing great work, not just fast work. The paradox: they believe in quality but accept quantity-level pay.

**The Accountability Paradox:** Extraordinary discipline for client work, zero discipline for own growth. They'll wake up at 2am with a fever to ship a video, but procrastinate on outreach for days. This is why courses fail but mentorship works.

**The Loneliness Pain Point:** 8-12 hours alone behind a laptop. Group calls and community solve a deep, often unstated need.

**The 9-to-5 Escape:** Many come from or are fleeing traditional employment. Having to go back to a "real job" is their nightmare scenario.

**The Respect Craving:** Money without respect is still misery. They want to be creative partners, not replaceable vendors.

**The Provider Motivation:** The "why" is often providing for someone they love or proving to family that freelancing works.

**The Imposter Syndrome Loop:** Despite skills, they constantly doubt their worth. They compare themselves to elite editors on X and conclude they're not good enough.

# Section 4: The Pain Landscape

## Surface-Level Pains

* Income stuck at $1-2K/month despite 40-60 hour weeks
* Client acquisition failures (ghosting, low response rates)
* Feeling stuck with no clear direction

## Deeper Pains

* Anxiety about next month's income
* Financial stress impacting sleep and health
* Family pressure to "get a real job"
* Burnout from overwork without proportional reward
* Life setbacks compounding (breakups, loss, financial hits)

## The Hidden Pain: Not Knowing What They Don't Know

**What they think:** "I need more clients / better editing / harder work"

**What's actually wrong:**
* No positioning (generalists in a specialist's game)
* No storytelling fundamentals (compensating with effects)
* No confidence framework (can't justify premium prices)
* No client acquisition system (hoping without a brand)
* No accountability (procrastinating on growth)

*For detailed pain quotes, see `voice-of-customer.md` → "CURRENT STATE" section.*

# Section 5: The Desire Landscape

## Immediate Desires

* Income: $3-5K/month (realistic), $7-10K/month (stretch)
* Client quality: 2-3 premium clients paying $1K+/video
* Fewer hours, more income

## Deeper Desires

* Freedom from financial stress ("not worry about money")
* Location independence (Thailand, Bali, travel)
* Respect and creative partnership with clients
* Proving themselves to family and self
* Life beyond editing (gym, friends, relationships)

## The Identity Transformation

* From "Just Editing" → "Building My Future"
* From "Replaceable" → "Irreplaceable"
* From "Bedroom Editor" → "Full-Time Editor™"
* From "Proving It to Others" → "Proving It to Myself"

**Central Truth:** Money is a proxy for identity transformation. They want to become someone who deserves respect.

*For detailed desire quotes, see `voice-of-customer.md` → "DESIRED STATE" section.*

# Section 6: Behavioral Patterns

## Where They Spend Time Online

**Primary:** Twitter/X (consuming, rarely posting), YouTube (tutorials), Discord communities

**Secondary:** Upwork, YTjobs, Reddit (r/freelance, r/VideoEditing)

**Pattern:** They consume far more than they create.

## Work Habits

* Optimize for input (hours) not output (income)
* Perfectionism as procrastination (spending too long on details clients don't notice)
* Work alone with no feedback loop

## The Procrastination Pattern

**What they DO:** Client work, consuming content, tweaking details

**What they DON'T:** Outreach, portfolio updates, posting on X, raising prices, skill development

**Why:** No external accountability for growth activities.

## Growth Attempts That Failed

* Mass email outreach (300-400/day, zero results)
* X posting with dead reach
* Generic courses that only cover 0 → $2K
* Being told "post on Twitter" without understanding positioning

---

# Section 7: The Objection Landscape

**Spoken:** Price/affordability (most common), need to consult parents, timing ("next month")

**Unspoken:** Fear of being scammed, comfort zone defense, previous bad coaching experiences

**What Overcomes Them:** Pre-sale value on the call, social proof from similar backgrounds, personalization, the "What If Everything Stays The Same?" question

*For detailed objection quotes and handling, see `voice-of-customer.md` → "OBJECTIONS & RESISTANCE" section.*

# Section 8: Segmentation

## By Experience Level

**Newer Editors (1-2 years):**
* More focused on skill development
* Higher imposter syndrome
* Questions: "What is storytelling?" / "What do $1K videos look like?"

**More Experienced (3+ years):**
* Frustrated by rates declining despite skill growth
* More cynical about the market
* Already have skills: missing positioning and systems

## By Geographic/Cultural Background

**Eastern European/Latin American:**
* Stronger family pressure, "$3K is a lot" ceiling
* Need to see someone from similar background succeed

**US/UK/Western:**
* More pressure to move out, higher cost of living
* More lifestyle-oriented goals

## By Living Situation

**With Parents:** Safety net reduces urgency BUT creates family pressure. Perfect investment window.

**Independent/With Partner:** Higher urgency, provider motivation, lower risk tolerance.

## By Motivation Type

**The Provider:** Supporting someone (girlfriend, family)
**The Escapee:** Running from 9-5/toxic situation
**The Prover:** Demonstrating success to self/others
**The Lifestyle Seeker:** Location independence, travel, freedom

# Section 9: Decision Psychology

**What makes them say yes:** Pre-sale value, proof from similar backgrounds, personalization, community, clear roadmap, the "What If" question

**What makes them say no:** Generic advice, no accountability, feeling judged, no emotional urgency, already in another program

**Green flags:** Living with parents, stuck 6+ months, strong relationship motivation, previous bad coaching (differentiation), already consuming free content

**Red flags:** Complete beginners, just want to "see what's inside," defending current situation, blaming external factors

*For detailed decision psychology with quotes, see `voice-of-customer.md` → "DECISION PSYCHOLOGY" section.*

# Section 10: The Transformation Journey

## Before State

* $1-2K/month, 40-60 hour weeks
* Constant financial stress, living with parents
* Isolated, imposter syndrome, scared to raise prices
* Taking any client that comes along

## After State

* $5-10K/month, 2-3 premium clients at $1K+/video
* 4-6 hour focused workdays (The 4-2-1™ Rule)
* Financial independence, travel, savings
* Confident pricing, choosing clients, creative partnership
* Part of thriving editor community

## The Transformation They're Actually Buying

* "Replaceable freelancer → Respected professional"
* "Clients who value my work" (not just more clients)
* "The confidence to charge what I'm worth"
* "Storytelling First™ as the differentiator"

*For transformation stories with quotes, see `voice-of-customer.md` → "TRANSFORMATION STORIES" section.*

# Section 11: Competitive Positioning

## Why Other Programs Fail Them

* Not advanced enough (take you from 0 → $2K, not $2K → $10K)
* Generic "post on Twitter" advice without positioning strategy
* No personal connection (YouTube videos repackaged as a paid community)

## What Makes FTE™ Different

1. **Advanced, Not Beginner:** $1-2K → $5-10K, different problem, different solution
2. **Niche-Specific:** Business/talking head editing, not generic
3. **Personalized Accountability:** Actual feedback on their work and situations
4. **Still-In-The-Arena:** Artem recently lived this exact journey, still edits
5. **Tight Community:** Not 10,000 randoms, editors at similar stages

# Section 12: Key Insights Summary

## The 5 Core Truths

1. **Money is a proxy for identity transformation.** They want to become someone worthy of respect.
2. **They need accountability, not information.** They'll meet any client deadline but procrastinate on growth.
3. **The skill gap is storytelling, not technical.** They can do After Effects. They can't do pacing.
4. **Loneliness is an underrated pain point.** Community is more valuable than they initially realize.
5. **Previous coaching failures create both skepticism and opportunity.** They've been burned, but looking for something different.

## The Perfect Prospect

* 18-23 years old
* Making $1-2K/month editing talking head/business content
* Living with parents (low expenses, runway to invest)
* 6+ months stuck at current income
* Has tried X posting, outreach, maybe a course, with limited results
* Strong "why" beyond money (girlfriend, family, escape)
* Quality over quantity mindset
* Already consuming Artem's free content
* Ready to be held accountable

## The Core Message That Resonates

"You're not a beginner anymore. You know how to edit. You have clients. But you're stuck, and you can feel it. The gap between where you are and $5-10K/month isn't as big as you think. It's not about working harder. It's about working differently. And you don't have to figure it out alone."
