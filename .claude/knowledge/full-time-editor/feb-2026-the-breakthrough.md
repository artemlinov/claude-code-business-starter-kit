## What It Is

Month 1 of the full FTE program, delivered as a standalone 30-day intensive. Same mentorship, same curriculum, same group calls, same community. Not a watered-down version.

**What's Included:**

- **The Breakthrough Call** — 30-minute personalized 1-on-1 + custom roadmap tailored to your situation
- 4 weekly edit reviews (personalized Loom feedback)
- Full curriculum access (all 3 pillars: editing, positioning, clients)
- 3x/week group calls (12 total) — including a weekly masterclass (full lecture with edit breakdowns, deep dives, actionable frameworks)
- Direct Slack access to Artem — message anytime, response within hours. Personalized Looms for complex questions. (Does NOT include unlimited scheduled 1-on-1 calls — that's full program only.)
- Community access (Slack + Skool)

## Core Positioning: Editor → Creative Director

The central insight behind The Breakthrough's messaging:

- **Editors** execute — they add animations, cut footage, follow instructions, deliver on time
- **Creative directors** think for the viewer — "Does this phrase need to be here? Is this pacing right? Will the viewer care? How do we restructure this to be more compelling?"

This is the gap between $300/video and $1,000+/video. Most editors have strong technical skills. What they're missing is the creative direction mindset — seeing from the audience's perspective.

"Creative direction" and "storytelling" mean the same thing, but "creative director" is more concrete, aspirational, and accurate. The Breakthrough is designed to develop this skill in 30 days.

**Important:** This applies to editors in any niche, not just business/YouTube content.

---

## The Breakthrough Call

This is what makes it mentorship, not a course.

Before they watch a single video or join a single group call, we get on a 30-minute 1-on-1 call. Artem learns their situation:

- Who are their current clients?
- What are they charging?
- What have they tried?
- Where are they stuck?

From there, we build THEIR roadmap. Not generic advice—a plan based on where they actually are.

**The honest frame:**

Some editors have quick wins available right away. If they're undercharging their current clients, we address it. If their positioning is off, we fix it.

Others need to build the foundation first. And that's fine. We figure out what THEY need.

Either way, we're working on their specific situation, not generic advice.

## Quick Wins (First 30 Days)

These aren't guarantees—they depend on the editor's situation. But this is what happens when editors get clarity and accountability:

- **Alejo:** Doubled his rate after The Breakthrough Call + landed a new client (under 1 month)
- **Belo:** $2K → $4K/month in one month
- **Abody:** Landed 2 clients paying $1K/video each in under a month
- **David:** Added $1K/month after The Breakthrough Call just from pricing clarity

**Key insight:** Quick wins happen in the first 30 days—which is exactly what The Breakthrough is. The bigger transformations take longer. Either way, by day 30 they'll know if this works for them.

---

## Why It Exists

The full FTE program is $3K / 4 months. Many editors on sales calls wanted to join but hesitated:

- "It's a big commitment"
- "What if it doesn't work for me?"
- "I'm not sure if mentorship is worth it"

The Breakthrough is the proof. 30 days and $499 to find out if FTE works for them.

## The 30-Day Experience

**Week 1: The Breakthrough Call + Diagnostic**

- 30-minute 1-on-1 with Artem
- Custom roadmap based on their situation
- First edit submission
- First group calls

**Week 2: Focus**

- Focused feedback on one core area
- First "aha moment" about creative direction
- Quick wins if available

**Week 3: Implementation**

- Advanced feedback on their edits
- Positioning and branding exploration
- Noticeable improvement

**Week 4: Decision Point**

- Progress review
- Decide to continue or walk away

---

## After 30 Days: Two Paths

**Path 1: Continue to full program**

- Upsell to full 4-month Full-Time Editor program at $3K (no credit from Breakthrough — it's standalone)
- Full program adds unlimited 1-on-1 calls with Artem
- Expected 50% conversion rate

**Path 2: Walk away**

- Keep all Loom feedback, notes, and community connections
- No further obligation
- Still valuable as a standalone experience

---

## Who It's For / Not For

**For:** Editors stuck at $1-2K/month who want to become creative directors but aren't ready to commit to the full 4-month program. The "try before you commit" option.

**Not for:** Beginners, passive learners, editors who won't submit work for review.

---

## Why This Works (Unlike Courses)

**Courses give information without accountability.**
They watch videos alone. No one checks if they're implementing. No one gives feedback on THEIR work.

**Communities are too big.**
10,000 people. They post a question, it gets buried. No personal attention.

**Generic advice doesn't work.**
"Post on Twitter." "Do outreach." "Raise your prices." Sure—but HOW? And what about THEIR specific situation?

**The Breakthrough is different:**

- Starts with a 1-on-1 call about THEIR situation
- Artem personally reviews their edits every week
- 10 people, not 10,000
- They can't hide—they submit or they don't

---

## Revenue Model

- 10 spots × $499 = $4,990 upfront
- 50% upsell to full program = 5 × $3,000 = $15,000
- **Total potential: ~$19,990 per cohort**

If expanded to 15 spots: $7,485 upfront + ~$22,500 upsells = ~$29,985
