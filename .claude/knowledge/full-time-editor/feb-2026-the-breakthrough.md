- Full curriculum access (all 3 pillars)
- 4x/week group calls (16 total)
- Community access (Slack + Skool)

## Core Positioning: Editor → Creative Director

The central insight behind The Breakthrough's messaging:

- **Editors** execute — they add animations, cut footage, follow instructions, deliver on time
- **Creative directors** think for the viewer — "Does this phrase need to be here? Is this pacing right? Will the viewer care? How do we restructure this to be more compelling?"

This is the gap between $300/video and $1,000+/video. Most editors have strong technical skills. What they're missing is the creative direction mindset — seeing from the audience's perspective.

"Creative direction" and "storytelling" mean the same thing, but "creative director" is more concrete, aspirational, and accurate. The Breakthrough is designed to develop this skill in 30 days.

**Important:** This applies to editors in any niche, not just business/YouTube content.

---

## Why It Exists

The full FTE program is $3K / 4 months. Many editors on sales calls wanted to join but hesitated:
- "It's a big commitment"
- "What if it doesn't work for me?"
- "I'm not sure if mentorship is worth it"

The Breakthrough is the proof. 30 days and $499 to find out if FTE works for them.

## The 30-Day Experience

**Week 1: Diagnostic** — Onboarding call, custom roadmap, first edit submission, first group calls
**Week 2: Focus** — Focused feedback on one Core Four element, first "aha moment" about creative direction
**Week 3: Implementation** — Advanced feedback, positioning/branding exploration, noticeable improvement
**Week 4: Decision Point** — Progress review, decide to continue or walk away

---

## After 30 Days: Two Paths

**Path 1: Continue to full program**
- $499 counts toward the $3K total
- Pay remaining $2,501 for Months 2-4
- No re-onboarding, seamless transition
- Expected 50% conversion rate

**Path 2: Walk away**
- Keep all Loom feedback, notes, and community connections
- No further obligation
- Still valuable as a standalone experience

---

## Who It's For / Not For

**For:** Editors stuck at $1-2K/month who want to become creative directors but aren't ready to commit to the full 4-month program. The "try before you commit" option.

**Not for:** Beginners, passive learners, editors who won't submit work for review.

---

## Revenue Model

- 10 spots × $499 = $4,990 upfront
- 50% upsell to full program = 5 × $2,501 = $12,505
- **Total potential: ~$17,500 per cohort**

If expanded to 15 spots: $7,485 upfront + ~$18,750 upsells = ~$26,235
