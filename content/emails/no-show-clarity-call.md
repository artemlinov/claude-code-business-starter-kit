# No-Show Email: Clarity Call

**Subject:** you missed your call

**Preview:** not gonna chase you on this

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

You had a Clarity Call booked with me today and didn't show up.

I'm not gonna chase you on this. I set aside time for you and there are other editors waiting for that spot.

But I do wanna be fair.

If you reply to this email with two things:

1) What happened.

2) Why you're serious about actually showing up this time.

I'll send you a new booking link.

If I don't hear back, I'll assume you're not ready and give your spot to someone else.

No hard feelings either way.

Artem
