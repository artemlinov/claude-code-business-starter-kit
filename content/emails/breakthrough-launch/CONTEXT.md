## The Offer

- **Name:** The Breakthrough (Full-Time Editor Breakthrough)
- **Price:** $499
- **Spots:** 10 (can expand to 15 "due to demand")
- **Launch Date:** February 14, 2026 (Friday)
- **Cart Close:** February 16, 2026 (Sunday midnight) — 3-day window
- **Checkout:** Gamma doc with Stripe payment link
- **Email Platform:** GoHighLevel

**What it is:** Month 1 of Full-Time Editor, delivered as a standalone 30-day intensive. Not a watered-down course. The same mentorship, curriculum, group calls, and community as the full program — just Month 1 only.

**What's included:**
- 30-minute personalized onboarding call + custom roadmap
- 4 weekly edit reviews (personalized Loom feedback)
- Full curriculum access (all 3 pillars)
- 3x/week group calls (12 total) — including a weekly masterclass where Artem prepares a full lecture (edit breakdowns, deep dives, positioning teardowns)
- Direct Slack access to Artem (response within hours, personalized Looms for complex questions)
- Community access (Slack + Skool)
- After 30 days: upsell to full 4-month program ($3K). No credit — Breakthrough is standalone. Full program adds unlimited 1-on-1 calls with Artem.

**Who it's for:** Editors stuck at $1-2K/month who want to become creative directors but aren't ready to commit to the full 4-month, $3K program. This is the "try before you commit" option.

**Who it's NOT for:** Beginners, passive learners, editors who won't submit work for review.

## Core Messaging Angle: Editor → Creative Director

This is the central insight threaded through all warm-up emails. It replaces the vaguer "storytelling" framing.

**The distinction:**
- **Editors** execute — they add animations, cut footage, follow instructions
- **Creative directors** think for the viewer — "Does this need to be here? Is this interesting? How do we restructure this?"
- This is the gap between $300/video and $1,000+/video
- You can't hit $5-10K/month as "just an editor" — you need to become a creative director
- The Breakthrough is the path from editor → creative director

**Key example:** Two editors get the same footage. The "editor" adds cool animations, follows the brief, delivers on time. The "creative director" removes redundant phrases, restructures sections for the viewer, makes decisions the client didn't ask for but will thank them for. Same skills. Completely different result. Completely different pay.

**Where this came from:** Artem realized this working with editors in FTE. They all have strong animation/technical skills. What they're missing is the ability to see from the viewer's perspective — removing what doesn't serve the story, restructuring for clarity and retention. "Creative direction" and "storytelling" are the same thing, but "creative director" is more concrete and aspirational.

**Important:** Don't limit this to business/YouTube content editors. The creative director mindset applies to any niche. Keep it broad.

## Two Segments

### Segment A: General Email List (2,000+ people)
- Editors who know Artem from YouTube/content
- Haven't had a sales call
- Approach: Value-first warm-up (creative director education) → build anticipation → launch → urgency close
- They don't know the program details — we're teaching them AND selling them
- Price is NOT revealed until launch day (Feb 14)

### Segment B: Past Sales Call Leads (~100 people)
- Had a sales call with Artem, didn't close
- Mixed recency: some 1-3 months ago, some 3-6+ months ago
- They already know the program, they already know Artem
- Their objection was usually price ($3K), commitment (4 months), or uncertainty ("will it work for me?")
- Approach: Re-engage with honesty and respect → introduce The Breakthrough as built for their exact objection → urgency close
- Price is revealed on Feb 5 (earlier than general list — they need to process it against the $3K they already said no to)

## Email Sequence — Segment A (10 emails)

### Warm-Up Phase (Feb 1-13)

**A1 — Sat Feb 1: "It's February. Be honest."**
- Type: Value / pattern interrupt
- Hook: It's February. How are those 2026 goals going?
- Content: Most editors set big income goals in January. Grind for a month. Then realize nothing changed. Not because they're lazy — because they're solving the wrong problem. You don't need more clients. You don't need to "work harder." You need to understand why editors with the same skills as you are charging 3-5x more.
- Purpose: Make them feel seen. No pitch, no tease.
- CTA: Reply — "What's your income goal for 2026?"

**A2 — Tue Feb 4: "You're not a video editor"**
- Type: Value / education
- Hook: If you're only charging $200-500/video, here's why.
- Content: Introduce editor vs. creative director distinction. Editors execute. Creative directors think for the viewer. That skill is the difference between $300/video and $1,000+/video.
- Purpose: Core philosophy. Create identity gap.
- CTA: "Next email, I'll show you exactly what I mean with a real example."

**A3 — Thu Feb 6: "The $300 edit vs. the $1,000 edit"**
- Type: Value / education
- Hook: Same footage. Same editor. Completely different result.
- Content: Concrete example of "just editing" vs. creative director approach — removing redundant phrases, restructuring for the viewer, making decisions the client didn't ask for.
- Purpose: Make the concept tangible. Real value.
- CTA: "If you want to learn how to think like a creative director, I have something coming. More on that soon."

**A4 — Mon Feb 10: "What I learned talking to 30+ stuck editors"**
- Type: Authority / anticipation
- Hook: I've had calls with dozens of editors stuck at $1-2K/month. They all say the same 3 things.
- Content: "I need more clients." "I need to improve my editing." "I need better luck." Wrong x3. The real problem: no positioning, no creative direction skills, no accountability. They have the hands — they're missing the eyes.
- Purpose: Seed the offer.
- CTA: "Something is coming this Friday. If you're stuck at $1-2K/month, keep your inbox close."

**A5 — Wed Feb 12: "10 editors. 30 days. Here's what's happening."**
- Type: Anticipation / reveal (no price)
- Hook: On Friday, I'm opening something I've never done before. Only for 10 people.
- Content: Explain the concept. Onboarding call, weekly edit reviews, full curriculum, group calls, community. Designed for editors who want to become creative directors. 10 spots because I personally review every edit. NO price yet.
- Purpose: Maximum anticipation. Curiosity gap.
- CTA: "Friday morning. 10 spots. Watch your inbox."

**A6 — Thu Feb 13: "Tomorrow morning"**
- Type: Reminder / hype
- Hook: Short email. Big day tomorrow.
- Content: 2-3 lines max. "Tomorrow I'm opening The Breakthrough. 10 spots. The lowest-risk way to find out what's actually holding you back. Details at 9am."
- Purpose: Keep it top of mind.
- CTA: "Check your inbox tomorrow morning."

### Launch Phase (Feb 14-16)

**A7 — Fri Feb 14, AM: "The Breakthrough is open. 10 spots. $499."**
- Type: Launch
- Hook: This is it.
- Content: Full offer reveal. Everything included. Who it's for. Who it's NOT for. Two paths after 30 days. 10 spots. $499. Doors close Sunday.
- CTA: Checkout link

**A7b — Fri Feb 14, PM: [TRIGGER: only people who did NOT click checkout in A7]**
- Type: Launch re-send
- Hook: "Did you see this morning's email?"
- Content: Short. Different angle — lead with the creative director transformation. "In 30 days, you'll know exactly what's holding you back from $1K/video clients."
- CTA: Checkout link

**A8 — Sat Feb 15: "[X] spots gone. Here's what they said."**
- Type: Social proof + urgency
- Hook: [X] editors claimed their spots in 24 hours.
- Content: Social proof + handle #1 objection ("what if it doesn't work for me?" — that's literally what this is for).
- CTA: Checkout link

**A9 — Sun Feb 16, AM: "Doors close tonight"**
- Type: Final urgency
- Hook: This is the last email about The Breakthrough.
- Content: Short. "What if" close. "What happens if we have this same conversation 6 months from now?" Doors close midnight. No extensions.
- CTA: Checkout link

**B1 — Sat Feb 1: "Hey [name] — quick update"**

- CTA: None. Seed.

**B2 — Wed Feb 5: "Why I built a $499 option"**
- Type: Offer introduction
- Hook: The full program is $3K. I get why that's a big decision.
- Content: "The biggest objection wasn't the program. It was the commitment. You wanted proof it would work for YOU. So I built that proof." Full Breakthrough concept. $499 counts toward full program.
- CTA: "Doors open Feb 14. Reply if you have questions."

**B3 — Mon Feb 10: "Editor vs. creative director"**
- Type: Value / education
- Hook: Here's what I've realized working with editors in the program.
- Content: Creative director insight. The Breakthrough develops this skill in 30 days.

- Type: Final urgency
- Hook: Doors close tonight.

- CTA: Checkout link

- Sign-offs in sequences use "Talk [day of next email]." not "Talk soon."
- Use numbered lists (1), 2), 3)) for structured arguments
- See "Rhythm & Pacing Patterns" section in `voice-of-artem-email.md` for all patterns
