Over the past year, I've talked to 100+ editors stuck at $1-2K/month.

Different countries. Different niches. Different skill levels.

But when I ask "what do you think is holding you back?"...

They all say the same 3 things:

"I need more clients."
"I need to get better at editing."
"I just need to get lucky with the right creator."

Sound familiar??

Here's the problem:

None of those are the real issue.

More clients won't help if you're charging $300/video. You'll just burn out faster.

Your editing is probably already good enough. Most stuck editors have solid technical skills.

And luck? Luck is positioning.

It's what happens when the right person sees your work and thinks "this person gets it."

The real problem is 3 things editors almost never talk about:

1) No storytelling skills.

Editors execute, creative directors think for the viewer.

That's the gap between $300 and $1,500. (I've been talking about this in the last few emails.)

2) Bad positioning.

You look like every other editor.

Same portfolio.
Same outreach.
Same "I'd love to work with you."

Nothing that makes a client think "this person is different."

3) No accountability.

You'll pull an all-nighter for a client deadline... but you'll procrastinate on your own growth for weeks.

You have the hands. You're missing the eyes.

The hands do the editing. The eyes see what the viewer sees.

And once you develop the eyes?

Everything changes...

The clients come easier. The pricing conversations get simpler. The work gets more fun.

I've watched it happen dozens of times now.

Something is coming this Friday that's designed to give you the eyes.

Talk Wednesday.
