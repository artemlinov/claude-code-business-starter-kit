[X] editors claimed their spots in the first 24 hours.

[INSERT 1-2 SHORT QUOTES OR PARAPHRASED REACTIONS FROM BUYERS — e.g. "I've been waiting for something like this" / "Finally something I can actually commit to"]

The most common question I'm getting:

"What if it doesn't work for me?"

That's literally what this is for.

30 days. $499. You'll know exactly what's holding you back and whether this path is right for you.

If it's not? You walk away. No lock-in. No pressure.

But if you've been sitting on this since yesterday's email... that hesitation is worth paying attention to.

→ [X] spots left. Doors close tomorrow midnight.
