This Friday I'm opening something I've never offered before.

I'm taking 10 editors through a 30-day intensive to turn them into creative directors.

Not a course. Not a community you join and figure out on your own.

Here's what actually happens:

1) You start with a 30-minute 1-on-1 call with me.

We build your custom roadmap based on where you are right now. Not a generic plan. Yours.

2) Every week, you submit an edit.

I record a personalized Loom breaking down exactly what to fix, what's working, and how to start thinking like a creative director. 4 weeks. 4 reviews.

3) You get full access to the curriculum I built for Full-Time Editor.

All 3 pillars: storytelling, positioning, and client acquisition.

4) Three group calls per week. 12 total.

One of them is a weekly Masterclass where I show you the creative director thinking in real time.

5) Direct Slack access to me.

Message me anytime. I get back within hours. If your question needs more than a text reply, I'll record a Loom walking you through it.

6) A community of editors going through the exact same thing. You're not doing it alone.

10 spots. That's it.

Why 10?

Because I personally review every single edit. I'm not outsourcing feedback to a coach or an AI tool. It's me.

The more editors I take, the less attention each person gets. And the whole point of this is attention.

I've spent the last year watching editors transform once they develop the creative director eye. The ones who submit work, get honest feedback, and actually apply it...

They stop competing on price. They stop stressing about empty timelines. They start making decisions clients thank them for.

That's what the 30 days are designed to do.

I'm not sharing the price until Friday. But I will say this:

If the full program ever felt like too big a commitment, this was built for you.

→ Friday morning. 10 spots. Watch your inbox.

Talk tomorrow.
