## SECTION 1: Hero

# The Breakthrough

## 30 days to go from editor to creative director.

10 spots. $499. Starts February 14.

You have the skills. You have the clients. You're still stuck at $1-2K/month.

This is the 30-day intensive that shows you exactly what's missing.

## SECTION 2: The Problem

# You're not a bad editor. You're solving the wrong problem.

You've tried posting on X. You've tried cold outreach. You've tried "improving your editing."

None of it moved the needle.

Here's why:

The gap between $300/video and $1,000+/video isn't technical skill. It's not more clients. It's not working harder.

It's how you think about the edit.

Two editors get the same footage.

The first one adds clean animations, follows the brief, delivers on time. Solid work. $300.

The second one removes a redundant paragraph, restructures the intro for retention, makes three decisions the client didn't ask for but will thank them for.

Same footage. Same technical skills. Completely different result. Completely different pay.

The first editor executes. The second editor thinks like a creative director.

That's the gap. And it's the only gap that matters.

## SECTION 3: Who This Is For / Not For

# Is this for you?

**This is for you if:**

You're making $1-2K/month editing videos. You're good at what you do. Clients like your work. But your income hasn't changed in months.

You know something is missing. You just can't name it.

You want to become the editor clients can't replace. The one who doesn't just edit, but thinks for the viewer.

You're ready to submit your work, get real feedback, and actually change.

**This is NOT for you if:**

You're a complete beginner with no clients yet. This isn't an editing course.

You want to watch videos and "learn at your own pace." There's no passive option here.

You won't submit your edits for review. The entire program is built around personalized feedback on YOUR work. If you're not willing to put your work up, this won't help you.

---

## SECTION 4: What The Breakthrough Is

# What is The Breakthrough?

Month 1 of Full-Time Editor, delivered as a standalone 30-day intensive.

Not a watered-down mini-course. Not a community with no structure. Not a bunch of pre-recorded videos you'll never watch.

This is real mentorship. Personalized feedback on your actual edits. Direct access to me. A small group of editors at your level all doing this together.

I built this for a specific reason:

The full Full-Time Editor program is $3K over 4 months. I've talked to dozens of editors who wanted in but weren't ready for that commitment.

"What if it doesn't work for me?"

"That's a lot of money when I'm making $1-2K/month."

"I want proof before I commit."

Fair enough.

The Breakthrough is that proof. 30 days. $499. Find out if mentorship actually works for you.

## SECTION 5: What's Included

# Here's exactly what you get.

**30-minute onboarding call + custom roadmap**
We start with a 1-on-1 call where I learn your situation, your niche, your goals, and your current edits. Then I build you a personalized 30-day roadmap. Not a template. Yours.

**4 weekly edit reviews**
Every week, you submit your work. I record a personalized Loom breaking down exactly what's working, what's not, and what to focus on next. Frame by frame. This is the core of the program.

**Full curriculum access (all 3 pillars)**
$1K Videos (Storytelling First, Core Four, The Editing Hierarchy), Elite Brand (positioning, portfolio, X strategy), and Client Flow (outreach, pricing, retention). Everything the full program teaches.

**12 group calls (3x per week)**
One weekly masterclass where I prepare a full lecture: edit breakdowns, deep dives, positioning teardowns. Plus two additional group calls for reviews and coaching. 12 calls in 30 days.

**Direct Slack access to me**
Message me anytime. I respond within hours. For complex questions, I send personalized Looms. You're not waiting for a weekly call to get unstuck.

**Community access**
A tight group of editors at your level. Not 10,000 random people in a Discord. Editors who are doing the work, sharing wins, and holding each other accountable.

## SECTION 6: The 30-Day Arc

# What 30 days actually looks like.

**Week 1: Diagnostic**
Onboarding call. Custom roadmap. Your first edit submission. First group calls. By the end of week 1, I know exactly where your gaps are and you have a clear plan.

**Week 2: Focus**
Targeted feedback on one specific element of your editing (pacing, structure, music, design). This is where the first "aha" moment hits. You start seeing your edits differently.

**Week 3: Implementation**
Advanced feedback. We start working on positioning and branding alongside your editing. Your improvement is noticeable. Clients start noticing too.

**Week 4: Decision Point**
We review your progress together. You've seen what mentorship does for your editing and your income trajectory. Two paths from here:

Path 1: Continue to the full 4-month Full-Time Editor program ($3K). Adds unlimited 1-on-1 calls with me.

Path 2: Walk away. Keep all your Loom feedback, notes, and community connections. No pressure. No obligation.

Either way, you leave with clarity you didn't have 30 days ago.

## SECTION 7: Social Proof

# Editors who made the shift.

**Marti, 16, Bulgaria**
Before: Making $150/video. Thought $500 was the ceiling for top editors.
After: "$1K per video. He was like, 'Yeah, that works.' And I was like, 'What the fuck did I just do?'" Now at $6.5K/month. His clients see him as a partner, not an employee.

**Botond, 18, Hungary**
Before: $300/video. Procrastinated on outreach for days. Posted on X with 100 impressions.
After: Signing clients at $2K/video. "The guys in the community are so nice. The group calls literally made my day." Actually enjoys his afternoons and evenings now.

**Taylor, 24, UK**
Before: Working in a warehouse freezer at minus 27 degrees. "I'm gonna get rich or die trying. Because I'm not doing this for the rest of my fucking life."
After: Got a DM from an 11-million subscriber YouTuber who found his work. $4K/month client. Living in Thailand.

**Kimi, 17, Germany**
Before: Stuck at $400/video. Stress watch constantly showing "high stress zone." Years of posting on Twitter with limited results.
After: Charging €2,000 per vlog. "I'm not as stressed anymore. I'm actually a healthy being now. What am I most proud of? The safety."

## SECTION 8: The Investment

# $499 for 30 days.

Let me put this in perspective.

One premium client at $1K/video covers this investment twice over.

One $500 client covers it completely.

And that's just the financial math. The real question is: what's another 6 months of being stuck at $1-2K/month actually costing you?

If you've been at the same income for months, you already know the answer.

This isn't $3K. This isn't a 4-month commitment.

This is 30 days to find out exactly what's holding you back and whether mentorship is the thing that breaks you through.

$499. 10 spots. That's it.

## SECTION 9: FAQ

# Common questions.

**How is this different from the full $3K program?**
The Breakthrough is Month 1 of Full-Time Editor as a standalone experience. Same curriculum, same group calls, same edit reviews, same community. The full program adds 3 more months plus unlimited 1-on-1 calls with me. Think of The Breakthrough as the proof. The full program is the transformation.

**What if my niche isn't business/YouTube content?**
The creative director mindset applies to every niche. Pacing, structure, storytelling, viewer psychology. These fundamentals work whether you're editing vlogs, podcasts, documentaries, or short-form content. I've worked with editors across all formats.

**How much time do I need to commit?**
You need to submit at least one edit per week for review and attend the group calls (3x/week). Budget 5-8 hours per week on top of your regular client work. The more you put in, the more you get out.

**What happens after 30 days?**
Two options. Continue to the full Full-Time Editor program ($3K, 4 months). Or walk away with everything you've learned, all your Loom feedback, and your community connections. No pressure either way.

**Is the $499 credited toward the full program?**
No. The Breakthrough is standalone. If you continue to the full program, the investment is $3K. The Breakthrough was designed to be worth it on its own.

**What if it doesn't work for me?**
That's literally what this is for. 30 days to find out. If you show up, submit your work, and engage, you'll know within the first two weeks whether this is working. The editors who don't see results are the ones who don't submit work for review.

## SECTION 11: Final CTA

# 10 spots. $499. Doors close February 16.

I'm keeping this small because I personally review every single edit.

10 editors. 30 days. That's the entire cohort.

When the spots are gone, they're gone. No waitlist. No extensions.

If you've been stuck at $1-2K/month and you want to know what's actually holding you back, this is the lowest-risk way to find out.
