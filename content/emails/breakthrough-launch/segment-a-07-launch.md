The Breakthrough is live.

For the past year, I've talked to dozens of editors who wanted to join Full-Time Editor but couldn't commit to $3K and 4 months. Not because they didn't believe in it. But because that's a big ask when you're stuck at $1-2K/month.

So I built something new.

The Breakthrough. Month 1 of Full-Time Editor as a standalone 30-day intensive. Same mentorship. Same curriculum. Same community. Not a watered-down version.

$499. 10 spots. Doors close Sunday midnight.

I put everything you need to know on the page:

What's included. Who it's for. Who it's not for. What happens after 30 days.

If you have questions, reply to this email. I read every one.
