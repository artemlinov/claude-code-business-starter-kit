The Breakthrough is live.

When we talked, the full program felt like a big leap.

I get it. $3K and 4 months is a real commitment when you're still at $1-2K/month.

This is the version I wish existed then.

30 days. $499. You get the full onboarding, the edit reviews, the curriculum, the group calls, the Slack access. Everything.

After that month, you either continue to the full program or you walk away. No lock-in. No pressure.

I built this because of conversations like ours. You were ready for the work. You just needed a way to test it first.

10 spots. Doors close Sunday at midnight.

Talk tomorrow.
