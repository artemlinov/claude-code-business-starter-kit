How long has it been since we talked?

3 months? 6 months? More?

You were stuck then. Making $1-2K/month. Wanting $5K. Knowing you could do the work but not knowing what you were missing.

What's changed since then?

Not what you've tried. Not what you've learned.

What has actually changed in your income, your clients, your situation?

If the answer is "not much"... that's worth paying attention to.

What happens if we have the same conversation 6 months from now and you're in the exact same position?

Same income. Same stress. Same frustration.

I'm not asking this to pressure you.

I'm asking because difficult questions are where the real progress is made.

Doors close tomorrow at midnight.

If it's not a fit, that's fine. But if you've been thinking about this for months and nothing's changed... maybe it's time to try something different.

Talk tomorrow.
