Full-Time Editor is $3K.

I get why that's a big decision.

The biggest objection I heard on sales calls wasn't the program itself.
It was the commitment.

You wanted proof it would work for YOU before going all in.

So I built that proof.

It's called The Breakthrough.
Month 1 of Full-Time Editor as a standalone 30-day intensive.

$499. 10 spots.

Here's what you get:

30-min onboarding call where we build your custom roadmap.
4 weekly edit reviews with Loom feedback from me.
Full curriculum access.
12 group calls (3x/week including weekly masterclass).
Direct Slack access to me.
Community access.

Same mentorship, same curriculum, same community. Just 30 days.

After that, you decide if you wanna continue with the full program or walk away. No lock-in.

I put everything on one page if you wanna see the full breakdown:

Doors open Feb 14. Close Feb 16.

If you have questions, just reply.

Talk Monday.
