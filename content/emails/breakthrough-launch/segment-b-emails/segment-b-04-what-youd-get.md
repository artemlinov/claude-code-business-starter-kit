You already know about The Breakthrough.

Here's how the 30 days inside will look like for you:

Week 1: Diagnostic.

You hop on a call with me. We build your roadmap. You submit your first edit and get a personalized Loom breaking down what's working and what's not.

Week 2: Focus.

We zero in on one element of your editing. Pacing, music, visuals, or design. This is where most people have their first real "aha moment."

Week 3: Implementation.

Advanced feedback. Positioning and branding exploration. The improvement starts becoming noticeable.

Week 4: Decision Point.

We review your progress. You decide if you wanna continue into the full program or walk away with everything you learned. No lock-in.
