{{contact.first_name}},

We talked a while back.

You decided it wasn't the right time — I respect that.

Since then, I've been building something new.

Something specifically for editors who wanted to work with me but couldn't commit to the full program.

You were one of the first people I thought of.

I'm gonna tell you about it this week.

No pressure. Just wanted you to know.

Talk Wednesday.
