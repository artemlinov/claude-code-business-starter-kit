I've been working with editors one-on-one for over a year now.

And I've noticed there are two types.

1) Editors.

They execute. Add animations. Cut footage. Follow the brief. Make it look good.

2) Creative directors.

They think for the viewer. "Does this need to be here? Is this interesting? How do we restructure this so it lands?"

Same skills. Completely different result.

And here's the thing:

This is the gap between $300/video and $1,500/video.

Two editors get the same footage.

The "editor" adds cool animations, follows the brief, delivers exactly what was asked for.

The "creative director" removes redundant phrases, restructures sections for the viewer...

Makes decisions the client didn't think about, but will thank them for.

The client watches both videos back.

One feels like an execution. The other feels like they had a partner who cared about the outcome.

That's the difference.

And it's not limited to business or finance... this applies to any niche.

The creative director mindset is what separates editors who are replaceable from editors who become indispensable.
