Last email I asked why editors with the exact same skills as you are charging 3-5x more.

Here's the answer:

They're not video editors.

Let me explain.

There are two types of people who open Premiere Pro every morning.

The first type is an editor:

They get footage, follow the brief, add some animations, clean up the audio, and deliver on time.

They do good work. Clients are happy. They charge $300-500/video.

The second type though?

They're creative directors.

And here's the interesting part:

They edit the same footage, but think differently.

Instead of just executing, they ask:

"What's the viewer thinking?"
"Does this phrase need to be here?"
"How do I restructure this so it actually lands?"

They remove stuff the client didn't ask them to remove. They make decisions the client didn't even think of, but will thank them for later.

Same footage. Same software. Same skills.

Completely different result. Completely different pay.

The editor charges $300/video.
The creative director charges $1,500.

And here's what most editors get wrong...

They think the gap is technical:

More plugins.
Smoother effects.
Fancier animations.

It's not.

The gap is how you think.

Editors think about the edit.
Creative directors think about the viewer.

That one shift is the difference between $1-2K/month and $5-10K/month.

And it's not something you pick up from a YouTube tutorial.

Next email, I'll show you exactly what I mean with a real example. Same footage, two completely different approaches. You'll see the gap clear as day.

Talk Thursday.
