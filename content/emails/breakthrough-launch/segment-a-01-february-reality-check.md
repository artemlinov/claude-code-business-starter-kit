If you're like most editors I talk to, you probably set a big goal for this year:

$10K/month.
Maybe $5K.
Or maybe just "more than last year."

Regardless, you've been grinding for a few weeks...

Posted on X.
Sent some outreach.
Tried to get better at editing...

Today is Feb 1st, and I've got a question for you:

Has something actually changed?

Got a new client?
Raised your prices?
Maybe improved your skills?

No? Keep reading...

There's a reason why none of those happened.

There's a reason why you're not any closer to your 2026 goals.

Whether that's $10K/month, $5K/month, or just "more than last year"...

And the reason is quite simple:

It's not because you're lazy.

We both know you're working your ass off.

It's because you're solving the wrong problem.

Most editors think the answer is more.

More hours.
More clients.
More outreach.

Luckily, it's not.

Think about it:

You're already working 40 hours per week, and want to 5x your income...

There's no way you can work 200 hours per week.

So clearly you need to work smarter, not harder.

The real question is: why are editors with the exact same skills as you charging 3-5x more?

What do they know that you don't?

I've been thinking about this a lot lately. And I have a pretty clear answer. But I'll save that for the next email.

For now, I just wanna know one thing:

→ What's your income goal for 2026? Hit reply and tell me.

Not the "safe" number. The real one.

Talk Tuesday.
