Hey {{contact.first_name}},

It's February.

How are those 2026 goals going?

If you're like most editors I talk to, you probably set a big number in January. $5K/month. Maybe $3K. Maybe just "more than last year."

You grinded for a few weeks. Sent some outreach. Maybe posted on X a couple times.

And now it's February and nothing has actually changed.

Same clients. Same rates. Same income.

That's not because you're lazy. You're probably one of the hardest-working people you know.

It's because you're solving the wrong problem.

Most editors think the answer is more clients, more hours, more outreach.

It's not.

The real question is: why are editors with the exact same skills as you charging 3-5x more?

What do they know that you don't?

I've been thinking about this a lot lately. And I have a pretty clear answer. But I'll save that for the next email.

For now, I just wanna know one thing:

→ What's your income goal for 2026? Hit reply and tell me.

Not the "safe" number. The real one.

Talk soon.

Artem
