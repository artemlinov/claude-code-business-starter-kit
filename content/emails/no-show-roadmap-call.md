**Subject:** you missed your call

**Preview:** not gonna chase you on this

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

You had a Roadmap Call booked with me today and didn't show up.

I'm not gonna chase you on this. These calls are limited and there are people on the waitlist who want them.

But I do wanna be fair.

If you reply to this email with two things:

1) What happened.

2) Why you're serious about actually showing up this time.

I'll send you a new booking link.

If I don't hear back, I'll assume you're not ready and give your spot to someone else.

No hard feelings either way.

Artem
