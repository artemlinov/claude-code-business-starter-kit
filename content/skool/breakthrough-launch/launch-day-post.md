**Title:** The Breakthrough is live.

---

A couple weeks ago I mentioned something was coming.

Here it is.

The Breakthrough is Month 1 of Full-Time Editor as a standalone 30-day intensive.

For editors who know there's a gap between where they are and $5K/month — and are ready to close it.

10 spots.
$499.
Doors close Sunday Feb 16 at midnight.

Here's what you get:

1️⃣ 30-minute onboarding call with me
2️⃣ 4 weekly edit reviews via Loom
3️⃣ Full curriculum access
4️⃣ 12 group calls (we meet 3x/week)
5️⃣ Private community & Slack access to me

After 30 days you decide. Continue to the full program or walk away. No lock-in.

If you're already inside Full-Time Editor — you're my priority. Nothing changes for you. This is a 30-day trial for editors who aren't ready for the full program yet.
