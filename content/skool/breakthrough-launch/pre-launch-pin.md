**Title:** Something new is dropping Feb 14...

---

I've been building something I've never done before.

And I'm kinda nervous about it.

It's for a very specific type of editor:

1️⃣ Someone who's in this community
2️⃣ Someone who knows they're capable of more, but feels stuck in the same spot.

Maybe you've been watching from the sidelines.
Maybe you've tried to go full-time before, and it didn't work.
Maybe you're doing okay, but you know something's missing...

This is for you.

I can't share all the details yet. But here's what I can tell you:

→ It starts Feb 14, and there will be only 10 spots.

More soon.

If you're reading this and something in your gut just went "wait, that might be me" — drop a comment. I wanna know who's paying attention.
