# Starter Story — Thumbnail Creation Process

## Key Rules

- **Never make it look AI** — every edit should look like the photo was taken that way
- **Composition is everything** — get this right and the thumbnail is 80% done
- **Photoshop for composition, Canva for finishing**
- **Don't overthink it**

## Process Overview

### 1. Pick the number

- Match the title — use whatever number is in the video title
- For A-B test variants, try: their biggest number from the video, or convert to a per-day amount (per-day has outperformed per-month before)
- If "per month" doesn't fit, use "MRR"

### 2. Select the best photo

- Guest should be **close to camera** — this is the #1 thing
- Laptop/screen visible and close to face
- Good expression, clean background
- If multiple photos, pick 2–3 to try different compositions

### 3. Decide on variants for A-B test

- **Version A:** Guest + big number text + arrow
- **Version B:** Clean photo, no text, guest at desk

### 4. Fix composition in Photoshop (if needed)

- Only use Photoshop when you need to move/reposition things (hands, laptop, subject)
- Skip Photoshop if the photo already has good composition
- **Remove distractions** (AC units, clutter) → AI removal
- **Optional:** add elements like Apple logo on laptop back (Gaussian Blur to make it glow)
- **Optional:** color grade in Photoshop if lighting is bad → Camera Raw Filter → Auto, tiny Lens Blur, Vignette
- Export as JPEG, high quality

### 5. Finalize in Canva

- **Magic Expand** if you need more canvas space
- **BG Remover** on a duplicate layer (foreground subject) — keep original behind (background)
- **Add subtle shading** behind subject — don't overdo it, too much looks AI
- **Add text** — as big as natural, with shadow (roughly -45° direction)
- **Add arrow** — grab color from the thumbnail, white outline/stroke

### 6. Export and upload for A-B test
