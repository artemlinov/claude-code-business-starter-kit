## The #1 Rule

**Never make the thumbnail look AI.** Everything we do — composition fixes, generative fill, color grading — should look like the guest actually took the photo that way. If it looks AI, we've failed.

> "The biggest thing for these thumbnails is not to make them look AI."
> — [Thumb 2 — 02.2 at 0:47](https://www.loom.com/share/aff81e82a8574dc69c130870a013044a?t=47)

---

## Step 1: Review the Video and Pick the Number

Before touching any photos, figure out what text/number goes on the thumbnail.

- Watch or skim the video to find the **biggest, most impressive number** the guest mentions
- Use that number as the main text (e.g., "17k MRR", "500k", "$533/day")
- If "per month" doesn't fit, use **"MRR"** instead — [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 16:50](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=1010)
- **Per-day numbers can outperform per-month** in A-B tests — [Thumb 3 — 03 at 37:02](https://www.loom.com/share/8485baee02da4cb6b66d968381a2547f?t=2222)
- If you want to use a calculated number (e.g., monthly × 12), only do it if the guest actually says that number somewhere in the video — [Thumb 1 — 01.2 at 2:24](https://www.loom.com/share/e8dad3d75ccc4411b0754afa6069c867?t=144)

## Step 2: Select the Best Guest Photo(s)

Look through all the photos the guest submitted and pick the best one(s).

**What makes a good photo:**
- Guest is **close to the camera** (not far away) — this is the biggest issue
- Laptop/screen is **visible and close to their face** — [Thumb 2 — 02.2 at 0:29](https://www.loom.com/share/aff81e82a8574dc69c130870a013044a?t=29)
- Good facial expression
- Clean background (no distracting objects)

**Common problems to watch for:**
- Guest too far from camera — makes cropping/framing very hard — [Thumb 3 — 03 at 0:41](https://www.loom.com/share/8485baee02da4cb6b66d968381a2547f?t=41)
- Laptop too far from face — we can fix this in Photoshop but it's harder — [Thumb 2 — 02.1 at 6:23](https://www.loom.com/share/a3565be87ec346ccb89f7459b0abd3ae?t=383)
- Thumb/hand too low in frame — we usually reposition this — [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 0:22](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=22)

---

## Step 3: Decide on Thumbnail Variants

We typically do **2 versions for A-B testing:**

1. **Text version** — Guest + big number text (e.g., "17k MRR") + arrow
2. **Clean version** — Guest at desk, no text, just a clean photo

> "Thumbnail one is clean, simple, no text, just guest at desk slash work environment. And thumbnail two is the usual one with text on screen."
> — [Thumb 2 — 02.1 at 1:20](https://www.loom.com/share/a3565be87ec346ccb89f7459b0abd3ae?t=80)

Sometimes we also try different compositions or number formats (per month vs per day) as additional variants — [Thumb 3 — 03 at 14:13](https://www.loom.com/share/8485baee02da4cb6b66d968381a2547f?t=853)

## Step 4: Composition Fix in Photoshop

This is the most important step. **Composition is the #1 thing that makes a thumbnail look good or bad.**

> "Getting the composition right really is the biggest challenge. But once you do get it right, the thumbnail just becomes so much better."
> — [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 2:29](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=149)

**When you need Photoshop:**
- The guest's hand/thumb needs repositioning (higher in frame)
- The laptop needs to be moved closer to the face
- You need to remove or move elements for better framing
- You need space for text that the original photo doesn't have

**When you DON'T need Photoshop:**
- The photo already has good composition
- You just need simple BG removal and text
- The clean/no-text version with minimal edits

### 4a. Reposition the Subject for Text Space

Move the background/subject down to create space on top for text:

- Duplicate the layer, move it down
- Use **Generative Fill** to fill the gap created at the top
- This gives you room for text without covering the subject

> See full walkthrough: [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 6:28 to 8:13](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=388)

### 4b. Reposition Hands/Thumbs

If the guest's thumb is too low in the photo:

1. Duplicate the original layer
2. Move it up slightly
3. Select just the hand/thumb area
4. This creates a version where the hand appears higher
5. On the layer below, remove the old hand position with Generative Fill

> Full hand repositioning: [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 8:28 to 9:52](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=508)
> Another example: [Thumb 3 — 03 at 5:14 to 7:23](https://www.loom.com/share/8485baee02da4cb6b66d968381a2547f?t=314)

### 4c. Move the Laptop Closer

When the laptop is too far from the guest's face:

1. Select and cut out the laptop
2. Move it closer/bigger
3. Use **Content-Aware Fill** to fill where the laptop was
4. Make sure it looks natural — check that hands still look like they're working, not just resting

> Full laptop repositioning: [Thumb 2 — 02.2 at 1:39 to 8:03](https://www.loom.com/share/aff81e82a8574dc69c130870a013044a?t=99)

### 4d. Remove Distracting Elements

Use Photoshop's AI removal to clean up:
- AC units, windows, clutter in background
- Old hand positions after repositioning

> Example — removing AC and hand: [Thumb 3 — 03 at 8:35 to 9:23](https://www.loom.com/share/8485baee02da4cb6b66d968381a2547f?t=515)

### 4e. Optional: Add Elements (e.g., Apple Logo)

If the laptop back is visible, consider adding a glowing Apple logo:
1. Find Apple logo PNG
2. Place it on the laptop
3. Add solid color layer
4. Apply **Gaussian Blur** to make it glow naturally

> Apple logo walkthrough: [Thumb 2 — 02.2 at 8:09 to 11:26](https://www.loom.com/share/aff81e82a8574dc69c130870a013044a?t=489)

### 4f. Color Grading in Photoshop (Optional)

Sometimes worth doing in Photoshop instead of Canva, especially when the guest's lighting isn't ideal:

- **Camera Raw Filter** → Auto for a quick base
- Add a tiny bit of **Lens Blur** for depth
- Add **Vignette** if it helps
- Don't overdo effects (haze, texture) — it can look AI

> Color grading in Photoshop: [Thumb 2 — 02.2 at 12:05 to 15:50](https://www.loom.com/share/aff81e82a8574dc69c130870a013044a?t=725)
> Overdoing effects: [Thumb 3 — 03 at 32:19](https://www.loom.com/share/8485baee02da4cb6b66d968381a2547f?t=1939)

### 4g. Export from Photoshop

- Export as **JPEG, quality high**
- Save multiple versions if you're experimenting (V1, V2, etc.)

> [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 10:14](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=614)

## Step 5: Finalize in Canva

Canva is where we add text, arrows, and do final color correction. It's easier and faster for finishing than Photoshop.

> "Finalizing in Canva is much easier than in Photoshop. This is kind of like my workflow in general — if you wanna mess around with composition, you do it in Photoshop. And then in terms of adding the text and stuff like that, you just do it in Canva."
> — [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 13:00](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=780)

### 5a. Import and Use Magic Expand (if needed)

If you need more canvas space:
- Use Canva's **Magic Expand** feature to generate extra background

> [Thumb 2 — 02.1 at 2:48](https://www.loom.com/share/a3565be87ec346ccb89f7459b0abd3ae?t=168)

### 5b. Background Removal

- Duplicate the imported photo
- Apply **BG Remover** on the duplicate (this becomes the foreground subject layer)
- Keep the original behind it (this becomes the background)

> [Thumb 2 — 02.1 at 9:01](https://www.loom.com/share/a3565be87ec346ccb89f7459b0abd3ae?t=541)

### 5c. Color Correction

Do this on the **background layer** (the one without BG removed):

- **Vibrance** — bump it up, but don't go crazy. Use vibrance, NOT saturation (saturation makes things look unnatural/yellow) — [Thumb 2 — 02.1 at 10:01](https://www.loom.com/share/a3565be87ec346ccb89f7459b0abd3ae?t=601)
- **Sharpness** — tiny bit for pop and clarity — [Thumb 2 — 02.2 at 21:26](https://www.loom.com/share/aff81e82a8574dc69c130870a013044a?t=1286)
- **Brightness** — brighten the subject slightly
- **Contrast** — add some but not too much
- Don't over-darken the monitor/screen if it's visible — [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 14:59](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=899)

### 5d. Add Shading/Shadow Behind Subject

- Add a subtle dark gradient or shadow behind the subject (between BG and foreground layers)
- Keep it **subtle** — too much shading makes it look AI
- Pat's feedback: shading sometimes makes backgrounds look AI, so be careful

> [Thumb 2 — 02.1 at 9:22](https://www.loom.com/share/a3565be87ec346ccb89f7459b0abd3ae?t=562)

### 5e. Add Text

- Place the number (e.g., "17k", "500k", "$533/day") as **big as you can** without it looking unnatural
- If "per month" doesn't fit, use **"MRR"**
- Position text so it doesn't clash with any text visible on screens in the photo
- Add **text shadow** — direction typically around -45 degrees
- If there's text on a monitor in the photo, **shade/wash out the monitor** so it doesn't compete with your added text

> Text placement and MRR: [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 15:30 to 17:04](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=930)
> Monitor shading to avoid text clash: [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 17:53 to 18:51](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=1073)

### 5f. Add Arrow

- Grab a color from the thumbnail itself for the arrow
- Arrow typically has a white outline/stroke
- Point it toward the text or the subject

> Arrow styling: [Thumb 1 — 01.1 at 19:37 to 20:58](https://www.loom.com/share/2e76341d3cf743f3b3d575449b9ac530?t=1177)

---

## Step 6: Export and A-B Test

- Export all variants from Canva
- Upload to YouTube as A-B test (typically 2 variants)
- Common test: text version vs clean/no-text version

> Setting up A-B test: [Thumb 3 — 03 at 17:51 to 19:50](https://www.loom.com/share/8485baee02da4cb6b66d968381a2547f?t=1071)

---

## Quick Reference — Key Rules

- **Composition is everything** — get this right and the thumbnail is 80% done
- **Never look AI** — every edit should look like the photo was taken that way
- **Photoshop for composition, Canva for finishing** — that's the workflow
- **Vibrance, not saturation** — saturation makes people look yellow
- **Don't make text too big** — it should feel natural, not overwhelming
- **Subtle shading only** — too much looks AI
- **Guest photos matter** — closer to camera = easier thumbnail
- **Per-day numbers can outperform** per-month in A-B tests
- **Don't overthink it** — [Thumb 2 — 02.2 at 24:25](https://www.loom.com/share/aff81e82a8574dc69c130870a013044a?t=1465)

## Photo Guidelines for Guests

If possible, communicate to guests (via Gus or whoever sends the brief):

- Take photos **close to the camera** — not zoomed out
- If holding a laptop, hold it **higher and closer to face**
- Thumbs up? Make the thumb **high** — it looks weird in person but great in thumbnails
- Good lighting makes everything easier to work with
- Multiple angles/poses so we have options
