# Add Tags in GoHighLevel

**Loom:** [INSERT LOOM LINK]
**Deadline:** Wednesday (urgent)

---

I gave you access to:
1. GoHighLevel
   - Let me know if you can log in
2. My two calendars
   - Old calendar — ends around September 25th
   - New calendar — starts in September

Two tags to add:
- `salescall-attended`
  - Editor Success Session
  - Roadmap Call
  - "[Name] x Artem" with no event type
- `discoverycall-attended`
  - Editor Clarity Session
  - Clarity Call

How to tag: find the person on the calendar, search them by email in GoHighLevel, scroll to tags, add the right one.

Ignore:
- Anything with "Starter Story"
- Anything with "Coaching"
- Group calls

Important:
- Never remove existing tags — only add
- If someone had a Clarity Session AND a plain "[Name] x Artem" call, add both tags
- Some tags are already there from before — many are still missing, go through everything
- No-shows still get tagged (e.g. Sedgar = discovery call no-show)

When you're unsure about someone, skip them and keep going. Batch all your questions into one message instead of asking one by one.

Let me know if you have any questions and if you can deliver by Wednesday.
