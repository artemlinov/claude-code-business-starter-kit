Okay so like I explained a few newsletters ago, a few months ago, that in 2025 I was traveling the whole year and now I am finally gonna be in a place long-term staying here and it's great. I set up the whole place exactly how I wanted it to be. It's really good for my YouTube. I'm focusing on YouTube at the moment. It's really great for editing. And right now I'm just in the building mode. I work every single day and all I think about is new projects, how do I improve full-time editor, how do I deliver better work for my clients, what YouTube video am I working on, all these things.
