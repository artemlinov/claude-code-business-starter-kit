All right another content idea. I had a coaching call with Bello yesterday. I mentioned that Starter Story reached out to me to help them with thumbnails. It's not because I'm the best thumbnail designer but instead because I understand Starter Story and their content and their audience really well.


That was my point is that as a video editor with your clients, you want to be making yourself irreplaceable by being a specialist for their specific content, and for their specific channel, and for their specific business. It's almost like you can think of it like niching down but not niching down to talking head videos or to finance videos, but instead niching down to this specific client. Just making everything hyper specific and learning about that hyper specificity makes you irreplaceable.


And then also for opportunities like literally I haven't been in touch with Starter Story for a few months, didn't do anything for them, and then Pat reached out and he was like "Artem, can you help us with our thumbnail process?" And it's not because I'm the best thumbnail designer but instead because I understand their channel and their content and I have all of that context.
