I just got an awesome personal story/content idea.


Basically I was editing a video and an animation took me way longer than expected. On the other side of the coin, what I started using AI a lot more recently and what makes AI actually produce a good output is context. Something we don't realise is that as people we have infinite context. Walking context windows. I'm 21 years old and all I am is just 21 years' worth of context. That's what people know me for; that's basically who I am right?


When it comes to AI and outsourcing, if you want AI to produce good outputs, then you need to give it as much context as possible. In your head you have a lot more context than you realise.


When hiring people or outsourcing work, the more context they know, the more valuable they are. Which is why working with someone for longer makes them more valuable just because every single day they're collecting context.


Going back to that animation that took me longer and reframing it in a way that "Okay, I'm collecting context for future videos for this client." You know I tried one thing it didn't work, I tried another thing it didn't work. "Why it didn't work" because "this," "this," and "that." In my case, I tried to use a bunch of different colours and they never worked. So I ended up just deciding to go for super simple animation, one colour red. That's it. That's context.


Thinking about you editing videos not just in a way where "Okay, I'm gonna deliver this video and get paid" $500 but instead building up this context window making it more and more extensive is a really good way to build relationships with clients. Just because the more context you have, the more valuable you're going to be to the client and then you're going to be able to raise prices.
