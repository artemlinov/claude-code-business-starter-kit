# The Breakthrough — VSL Talking Points

**Format:** 2-3 minutes, casual, from the heart. Not scripted word-for-word—just hit these beats in your own words.

## 1. Pattern Interrupt

"If you're watching this, you're probably not a beginner. You know how to edit. You have clients. But something's off."

---

## 2. Name the Feeling

The stuck feeling. Working 40-50 hours a week. Making $1-2K a month. Watching other editors charge $1K per video and wondering what you're missing.

You've probably tried things—posting on X, doing outreach, maybe even a course. And nothing really moved the needle.

## 3. The Real Transformation

Here's what I've learned talking to dozens of editors in this exact spot:

What separates $300/video editors from $1,000/video editors isn't After Effects tricks. It's not working harder. It's creative direction—thinking for the viewer, not just executing a brief.

That's what this is about. Turning you from an editor into a creative director.

## 4. But It's Not Just Editing

We also work on your business. Pricing. Positioning. Landing clients.

Because you can be a great editor and still be broke if no one knows how to find you.

## 5. Why This Is Different (The Breakthrough Call)

This isn't a course you watch alone. It isn't a community where you get lost in 10,000 people.

It starts with a 30-minute call—just you and me. I learn YOUR situation. Your clients. Your rates. What's holding you back.

From there, we build a roadmap tailored to you. Not generic advice. A plan based on where you actually are.

Some editors have quick wins available right away—maybe you're undercharging your current clients, or your positioning is off. Others need to build the foundation first. Either way, we figure out what YOU need.

## 6. Why I Built This

I've had dozens of calls with editors who wanted to join Full-Time Editor. They believed in the program. But $3K and 4 months felt like a big leap.

So I built a 30-day version. Same mentorship. Same curriculum. Same calls. Just month 1.

Proof before commitment.

## Quick Wins to Mention (If Natural)

These are real examples—use them if it flows naturally:

- Alejo doubled his rate after The Breakthrough Call and landed a new client within a month
- Belo went from $2K to $4K/month in his first month
- Abody landed 2 clients paying $1K/video each in under a month

Frame: "These aren't guarantees—they depend on your situation. But this is what happens when you get clarity and accountability."
