## What is The Breakthrough?

Month 1 of Full-Time Editor—delivered as a standalone 30-day intensive.

This isn't a watered-down version. It's the same mentorship, the same curriculum, the same group calls, the same community. Just month 1.

It starts with The Breakthrough Call: a 30-minute 1-on-1 where we diagnose your situation and build a roadmap tailored to you.

Built for editors who want proof before committing to the full program.

## Who This Is For

**This is NOT for:**

- Complete beginners. You need to already have clients and know how to edit.
- Passive learners who just want to watch content.
- Editors who won't submit work for review.

**This IS for:**

- Editors stuck at $1-2K/month who want to become creative directors
- Editors who've tried posting on X, outreach, maybe a course—with limited results
- Editors who want proof that mentorship works before committing to 4 months
- Editors who know they're missing *something* but can't name it

## The Core Problem

**Editors execute.**

They add animations. Cut footage. Follow instructions. Deliver on time.

**Creative directors think for the viewer.**

"Does this phrase need to be here? Is this pacing right? Will the viewer care?"

Same footage. Same editor. Completely different result.

The editor adds cool animations and follows the brief.

The creative director removes redundant phrases, restructures sections for the viewer, makes decisions the client didn't ask for but will thank them for.

This is the gap between $300/video and $1,000+/video.

You probably already have the technical skills.

What you're missing is creative direction—and a business that matches your skill level.

---

## It Starts with The Breakthrough Call

This is what makes it mentorship, not a course.

Before you watch a single video or join a single group call, we get on a 30-minute 1-on-1 call.

I learn your situation:

- Who are your current clients?
- What are you charging?
- What have you tried?
- Where are you stuck?

From there, we build YOUR roadmap. Not generic advice—a plan based on where you actually are.

**Some editors have quick wins available right away.**

If you're undercharging your current clients, we address it. If your positioning is off, we fix it.

**Others need to build the foundation first.**

And that's fine. We figure out what YOU need.

**Examples:**

- Alejo doubled his rate after The Breakthrough Call and landed a new client within a month
- Belo went from $2K to $4K/month in his first month
- Abody landed 2 clients paying $1K/video each in under a month

These aren't guarantees—they depend on your situation. But this is what happens when you get clarity and accountability.

## After 30 Days: Two Paths

**Path 1: Continue**

If it's working, you can continue to the full 4-month Full-Time Editor program ($3K).

The full program adds unlimited 1-on-1 calls with Artem.

You'll already know if this is right for you.

**Path 2: Walk Away**

Keep all your Loom feedback, notes, and community connections.

No further obligation.

Still valuable as a standalone experience.

Either way, you'll know exactly what's been holding you back.

## Why This Works (Unlike Courses)

**Courses give information without accountability.**

You watch videos alone. No one checks if you're implementing. No one gives feedback on YOUR work.

**Communities are too big.**

10,000 people. You post a question, it gets buried. No personal attention.

**Generic advice doesn't work.**

"Post on Twitter." "Do outreach." "Raise your prices."

Sure—but HOW? And what about YOUR specific situation?

**The Breakthrough is different:**

- Starts with a 1-on-1 call about YOUR situation
- I personally review your edits every week
- 10 people, not 10,000
- You can't hide—you submit or you don't

## The Investment

**$499. 10 spots.**

One client at $500/video pays for itself.

The editors I work with typically see their first results within 30 days.

This is the lowest-risk way to find out what's actually holding you back.

---

## Questions You Might Have

**"What if I'm too new?"**

If you have at least one client and know how to edit, you're ready. If you've never edited a video before, this isn't the right fit.

**"What if I can't make the group calls?"**

All calls are recorded. But the more you show up live, the more you'll get out of it.

**"Is this a course?"**

No. There is curriculum, but this is mentorship. The difference: I give you personalized feedback on your actual work, starting with The Breakthrough Call.

**"What happens after 30 days?"**

Two paths: continue to the full 4-month program ($3K) or walk away with everything you learned. No pressure either way.

**"Why $499?"**

This is month 1 of a $3K program. I want to make this accessible for editors who aren't ready to commit $3K without proof it works.

**"Will I definitely get quick wins?"**

It depends on your situation. Some editors have quick wins available right away (pricing, existing clients). Others need to build the foundation first. The Breakthrough Call is where we figure out what applies to you.

## What Happens When Editors Commit

**Quick wins (first 30 days):**

- Alejo doubled his rate after The Breakthrough Call + landed a new client (under 1 month)
- Belo went from $2K to $4K/month in one month
- Abody landed 2 clients paying $1K/video each in under a month
- David added $1K/month after The Breakthrough Call just from pricing clarity

**Full program transformations:**

- Marti: $150/video → $6.5K/month
- Taylor: warehouse freezer → $4K/month client

Quick wins happen in the first 30 days. The bigger transformations take longer.

Either way, you'll know if this works for you.
