# Claude Code for Business - Starter Kit

Your AI Employee infrastructure. Build AI systems that do real work in your business.

## IMPORTANT: Working Directory

**You MUST open THIS folder directly in VS Code.**

If you cloned this repo into a subfolder, make sure VS Code opens the folder containing this `CLAUDE.md` file at the root - NOT a parent folder.

**Correct:** VS Code opens `claude-code-business-starter-kit/`
**Wrong:** VS Code opens a parent folder that contains `claude-code-business-starter-kit/`

If skills, MCPs, or agents aren't working, this is usually why.

## Routing

| When you want to... | Load skill |
|---------------------|------------|
| Create a new skill | `create-skill` |
| Create a new command | `create-command` |
| Create a new agent | `create-agent` |
| Create a new hook | `create-hook` |
| Add or build an MCP | `create-mcp` |
| Search online for MCP servers | `mcp-finder` agent (spawned by create-mcp) |
| Write a YouTube description | `youtube-description-writer` + appropriate voice skill |
| Write content for Alex | `voice-of-alex` |

---

## Output Organization

**Principle:** Never dump files in root. Outputs go in logical folders.

| Output Type | Location | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Content | `content/[type]/[project]/` | `content/youtube/competitor-analysis/` |
| Research | `research/[topic]/` | `research/ai-tools/` |
| Data | `data/[source]/` | `data/youtube-api/` |
| Exports | `exports/[format]/` | `exports/csv/` |

**When creating skills that produce output:**
1. Determine what TYPE of output (content, research, data, export)
2. Create the appropriate folder structure
3. Use descriptive project/topic names
4. Keep related files together
